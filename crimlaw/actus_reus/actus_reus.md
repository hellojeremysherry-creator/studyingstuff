Criminal liability requires a voluntary act. *Martin v. State*. 

* Martin’s drunkenness and profane speech were voluntary, but the element of appearing in public was involuntary, because the police forcibly transported him there.  
  * A person cannot be criminally liable purely on the basis of status or being in a condition not produced by a voluntary act.  
  * A defendant cannot be held criminally liable unless the conduct that constitutes the offense includes at least one voluntary act tied to the prohibited situation.  
* Whether a defendant can be convicted of public drunkenness when the defendant’s appearance in public was involuntary due to forcibly transporting the defendant there.  
  * Martin was arrested in his home, and then forcibly transported by these police officers to a public setting. Under Alabama’s public drunkenness statute, criminal liability attaches when a person voluntarily appears in a public place while intoxicated and demonstrates drunken behavior. In this public setting, although Martin manifested profane behavior, his appearance in public was involuntary, giving rise to the central question of voluntariness.   
  * The court reasoned that since the statute presupposes a person’s voluntary appearance in a public place, and because the officers forcibly transported Martin from his home to a public setting, the element of appearing in public was involuntary; thus failing to satisfy the actus reus of the offense. Therefore, the conviction must be reversed.

Criminal liability requires that the actor was acting with conscious awareness. *People v. Newton*. 

* Can a defendant be held criminally liable for homicide when the defendant’s physical conduct occurred while they were involuntarily unconscious or semiconscious due to reflex shock from being shot?  
  * A defendant cannot be held criminally liable when the defendant’s unconsciousness or semiconsciousness is not self-caused, and the defendant’s physical conduct occurs without conscious awareness, because involuntary unconsciousness means there is no voluntary act.  
* Newton was stopped by officers, a struggle ensued, and Newton was shot in the stomach. Medical testimony stated that such trauma can cause reflex shock leading to unconscious or semiconscious states. Newton testified he remembered the events leading up to the shooting, then nothing until being in the hospital. While some evidence suggested Newton may have fired shots while unconscious, the jury received no instruction on unconsciousness as a defense.  
  * The court reasoned that unconsciousness, where not self-caused, is a complete defense because it negates the voluntary act element. Newton introduced evidence supporting his claim that he was unconscious during the criminal act, and was thereby entitled to a jury instruction on that defense. Thus, the trial court’s failure to provide one was prejudicial error requiring reversal.

There is no criminal liability for failing to act unless a legal duty exists. *Jones v. United States*.

* May a defendant be held criminally liable for manslaughter for failing to care for a child when the existence of a legal duty was disputed and the jury failed to receive instructions that such a duty is required?   
  * A defendant may be criminally liable for an omission only when a legal duty to act exists, arising from: (1) a statutory duty to care for another, (2) a status relationship (e.g., relationships designated by law as giving rise to a duty of care), (3) a contractual duty to care for another, or (4) a voluntary assumption of care of another combined with seclusion of the helpless person so as to prevent others from rendering aid. *Jones* is concerned with (3) and (4).   
* Jones failed to provide care to Anthony Lee Green, a ten‑month‑old child who died as a result of that failure. Anthony Lee was the son of Shirley Green and had been placed with Jones, a family friend. There was conflicting evidence about: How long Shirley Green actually lived in the house with Jones and Anthony Lee. Whether Jones was paid for taking care of the baby. Jones argued that Shirley Green was actually living with her and the child and therefore should have been caring for the child herself; Shirley Green testified she was living with her parents and paying Jones to care for both children. It was uncontested that Jones had ample means to provide food and medical care for Anthony Lee.  
  * The court recognized that, under some circumstances, the omission of a duty owed by one individual to another, where such omission results in the other’s death, can make a person liable for manslaughter. But because this rule is always based on the proposition that the duty neglected must be a legal duty, not a mere moral obligation, the question of whether a defendant had a legal duty (e.g., by contract with the mother or by assuming and secluding the child) presents critical issues of fact for the jury. The jury in *Jones* failing to receive instructions on the necessity of finding a legal duty constitutes plain error, thus requiring reversal.  
* No. Since the existence of a legal duty in an omission-based manslaughter prosecution is a critical element of the crime, the jury must thereby be instructed that it must find this duty beyond a reasonable doubt. The failure to instruct the jury on the necessity of finding a legal duty constitutes plain error, and thus requires reversal.
