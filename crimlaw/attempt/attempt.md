*Intent requirement; specific intent; attempted manslaughter; transferred intent; recklessness; attendant circumstances; attempted crime matches mens rea of completed crime.*

*How much intent is required; how much conduct is enough; punishment compared to the completed crime; someone who abandons the plan and gets a defense.*

**In NY, a defendant is deemed to have committed an attempt** where, with the requisite intent to commit a crime, the defendant engages in conduct that tends to effectuate the commission thereof.

**In CA, every person who attempts to commit any crime**, but fails, or is prevented or intercepted shall be punished.

**Other states use “substantial step” language**. In Illinois, a defendant is deemed to have committed an attempt where, with the requisite intent to commit a specific offense, they do any act constituting a substantial step toward commission. 

**Attempt usually requires a purpose/specific intent** as to the target offense (especially as to results). An attempt requires a purpose to produce the proscribed result. Smallwood v. State.

**Every attempt requires specific intent to commit the target crime** even if the completed crime does not require specific intent. People v. Beck.

**Attempted murder / assault with intent to murder requires specific intent to kill**. Intent may be proven circumstantially; sometimes inferred where the defendant uses a deadly weapon aimed at a vital part (the “natural and probable consequence inference”).

* ***Mens rea:** usually purpose/specific intent as to the target offense (especially as to results).*  
* ***Actus reus:** conduct beyond mere preparation—dangerous proximity; equivocality / res ipsa loquitur; substantial step strong corroborative*. People v. Rizzo; People v. Miller.

**Under the MPC and NY**, abandonment/renunciation may be a defense.

**Attempt usually merges into the completed offense** (cannot convict of both ‘attempt’ and completed crime for the same victim/result), with complexities in transferred intent situations.

**Attempt requires purpose to bring about the target crime**. Attempt requires a specific intent (purpose) even if the completed offense can be committed with a less culpable mens rea (recklessness, negligence).

* Smallwood v. State reversed the attempted murder and assault-with-intent-to-murder convictions stating that the risk exposure alone was not enough to prove specific intent to kill. This contrasts that demonstrated facts sufficient for establishing specific intent and to convict for attempted murder—like in State v. Hinkhouse where the defendant demonstrated concealment, lying about AIDS status, refusing protection, statement suggesting they’d spread the virus; or like in State v. Caine where the defendant jabbed someone with a used syringe while yelling they’d give them AIDS.

For attempted murder, most JDXs demand proof that the defendant had a purpose to kill, or (under MPC-like approaches) a belief death would result, not merely recklessness about a risk of death.

**Specific intent is a heightened level of intent** where the defendant acts with the conscious purpose of bringing about a particular result, such as death.

**Attempted involuntary manslaughter is self-conflicting** because the crime of involuntary manslaughter involves an unintentional killing while an attempt requires a specific intent to kill. State v. Holbron. **Attempted voluntary manslaughter logically lines** up so long as the elements of attempt and the mental state required for voluntary manslaughter are met. The defendant must take a substantial step toward committing the crime, which is committed in the heat of passion or sudden quarrel. State v. Brown.

* *Killing in the heat of passion does not preclude the possibility of an attempt-conviction; even though heat of passion killings are spontaneous, a defendant can still form the intent to kill in the moment and take a substantial step toward doing so.*

**Conduct demonstrating extreme indifference to the value of human life**, creating a substantial risk of death may likely be sufficient to constitute a conviction for attempted murder. People v. Rubio.

**Under the MPC, reckless endangerment** is a possible way to punish extremely dangerous risk-creation conduct that is not attempt-related.
