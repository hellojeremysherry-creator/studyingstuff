**Actual (factual) cause**: *but-for the defendant’s conduct, would the harm have occurred?*  
**Proximate (legal) cause**: *is the connection between conduct and harm close enough that it’s fair and just to impose liability?*

***Burrage v. United States*** rejects contributing factor or substantial factor and requires either: but-for causation, or the defendant's act is an independently sufficient cause.

**The substantial factor test is used in CA** in jury instructions when there are multiple sufficient causes. An act causes the result if it is a substantial factor, i.e., more than trivial or remote.

Federal analysis uses the **independently sufficient cause** approach: if the defendant’s conduct is an independently sufficient cause, liability can attach even if there is another sufficient cause.

**An omission can be an actual cause** if the defendant had a legal duty to act and the failure to act was a but-for condition of the result.

**The modern majority framework for proximate (legal) cause** is that the result must be the direct, natural and probable consequence of the defendant’s act; a natural/probable consequence is one a reasonable person would see as likely, barring atypical intervention.

* **California language: “outer limit” phrasing** is that proximate cause exists unless the result is highly extraordinary given the circumstances.  
* **NY’s language: sufficiently direct cause**; harm should have been foreseen as reasonably related to the defendant’s act.  
  * **Scope-of-the-risk**; did the defendant’s wrongdoings increase the risk of the kind of harm that occurred?

**Dependent intervening cause is a response** to the defendant’s conduct (rescue, flight, standard medical treatment, predictable negligence) usually does not break the chain of causation.

**Independent intervening cause is a new causal force** not set in motion by the defendant and not a normal response (especially a free, informed, voluntary human choice); can break causation if sufficiently unforeseeable/abnormal.

**Act/omission causes injury if it is a direct, natural, and probable consequence** of the defendant’s acts, the injury would not have happened without the defendant’s acts, and if there are multiple sufficient causes, defendant’s conduct must be a substantial factor. 

**Factual causation exists when** the defendant’s act explains the victim’s presence at, or interaction with, the fatal instrumentality — not merely the victim’s broader life circumstances.

**A result is proximately caused if it is not a highly extraordinary** consequence of the defendant’s conduct, judged objectively at the time of the act. Foreseeable does not mean common or previously documented. Negligence by third parties usually does not sever causation. Only abnormal, unforeseeable, or bizarre negligence does.

**A defendant may proximately cause a death that they did not consciously risk** (no malice), so long as the death was not a highly extraordinary consequence of the dangerous situation they created.

**Result element**: death/injury/etc.  
**Actual cause**: but-for; if multiple sufficient causes exist, analyze for substantial factor / independently sufficient cause analysis.  
**Proximate cause**: direct/natural/probable; foreseeable and within the scope of risk; not highly extraordinary.  
**Intervening cause**: 

* dependent response (rescue, flight, ordinary negligence) usually does not break the causal chain.  
* independent/free/voluntary act may be a superseding cause if conditions are abnormal/unforeseeable.  
* medical negligence typically does not break the causal chain unless conditions are grossly improper and original injury is not a substantial factor (CA pattern).

**Thin skull / refusal of treatment**: vulnerability/refusal of treatment typically is not a defense if the defendant’s act is still a substantial factor. 

**An intervening act does not break proximate cause when** it is a foreseeable response to the dangerous situation the defendant created, even if the response involves negligence or risk-taking. But an intervening act does break causation when it reflects autonomous, self-directed risk unrelated to managing that danger.

**When the defendant’s conduct creates a dangerous situation**, and the victim is harmed by a foreseeable response to that danger, proximate cause is satisfied even if a third party acts negligently.  

* *The pilot’s conduct was not a pressured response to the high speed chase. It was acted on intentionally as a response to impress TV camera crews.*

**A free voluntary, informed human choice ordinarily breaks the causal chain**, even if the choice was foreseeable or even intended by the defendant.

**Voluntary, reckless, or even criminal acts by third parties** almost never defeat but-for causation. They are analyzed at the proximate-cause stage.
