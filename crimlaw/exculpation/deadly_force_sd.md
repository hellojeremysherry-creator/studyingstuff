**Necessity:**

* *Whether the force was necessary—especially deadly force*

**Imminence / immediacy:**

* *Whether the threatened harm was imminent or force immediately necessary*

**Proportionality:**

* *Deadly force only for threats like death/serious bodily injury/forcible felonies*

**Reasonableness:**

* *Subjective belief plus objective reasonableness*

**Retreat:**

* *Duty to retreat or stand-your-ground or castle doctrine*

**Aggressor / Provocation:**

* *Fault can forfeit self-defense*

**Third-part risk:**

* *Bystanders injured during justified defense*

**Burden of proof:**

* *Who must prove or disprove self-defense*

**To justify deadly force under CL**: (1) unlawful threat against the defendant or another; (2) defendant actually believes deadly force is necessary; (3) the belief is objectively reasonable; (4) threat must be imminent; (5) proportionality in that deadly force only to prevent death or serious/great bodily harm or specific forcible felonious conduct; (6) an initial aggressor/provoker generally loses the defense unless withdrawal is clearly communicated; (7) retreat (some states), outside the home, if retreat can be accomplished in complete safety.

**Under the MPC’s retreat, deadly force is not justified** if the actor knows they can avoid the necessity of using deadly force with complete safety by retreating (with exceptions like being in one’s dwellings, etc., depending on formulation).

**Under the MPC’s aggressor / provocation frameworks, one forfeits a deadly-force justification only if** the actor provoked with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm (and other constraints), which is narrower than the broad ‘free from fault’ approach in many CL cases.

**The MPC’s protection of property / habitation model generally limits deadly force** strongly, but allows it in narrow circumstances—i.e., where nondeadly prevention would expose the actor to substantial danger of serious bodily harm.

**Under the MPC’s recklessness/negligence** toward third parties framework, even if force is justified against the aggressor, the defender can be liable for reckless/negligent injury to bystanders.

*Imminence vs. inevitable future harm; necessity vs. alternatives/escape/help; justification (perfect SD) vs. mitigation (imperfect SD)*. State v. Norman.

**The MPC allows SD where force is immediately necessary**, potentially helping defendants who cannot show strict imminence but can argue necessity under the circumstances.

**In NJ an individual must retreat before using deadly force** if they know they can do so with complete safety, except when they are in their own dwelling.

* *The use of force in SD is justified when the individual reasonably believes such force is necessary to protect themselves from imminent unlawful force.* State v. Abbott.

Stand-Your-Ground statutes removes the duty to retreat, even in public, and the Castle Doctrine also governs that there is no duty to retreat in one’s home against intruders.

**In Indiana, a person cannot claim SD if they are committing a crime** that is causally connected to the confrontation during which they use deadly force.

**Under the MPC, provocation forfeits deadly-force justification** only when the actor provokes with the purpose to cause death/serious bodily harm.

**Under CL’s aggressor rules, you cannot claim SD if you create the necessity** to kill via provocation/aggression. The aggressor can regain SD only by withdrawing in good faith, and communicating withdrawal. United States v. Peterson.

**Deadly force in defense of property/habitation is usually limited** to circumstances where intrusion reasonably threatens death/serious bodily harm.

**Under CL, if a defender is justified against the assailant**, accidental killing of a bystander may be excused (at least where the defender was not acting wildly/carelessly).

* *Some JDXs reason if intent transfers, justification transfers too*.

**The MPC rejects blanket immunity and permits liability** for recklessness/negligence toward bystanders even if justified against the aggressor.

**Once SD is raised, prosecution must disprove** SD beyond a reasonable doubt.

**In CA, homicide is justifiable when** resisting an attempt to murder, to commit a felony (e.g., forcible and atrocious), or to cause great bodily injury upon any person, or when committed in defense of habitation, property or person against someone who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony. The use of deadly force is justifiable only when there is a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm.

* *The use of deadly mechanical devices is not permissible, as they cannot exercise discretion and pose indiscriminate risks to anyone triggering them.* People v. Ceballos.

Failure of proof / element negating defenses. 

* *Defendant argues the prosecution did not prove an element (identity, act, mens rea, causation, etc.).*  
* *Prosecution must prove the crime and defeat reasonable doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.*

Justification & excuses.

* *These defenses do not negate offense elements, they negate liability even when the elements are satisfied (e.g., intentional killing \+ self-defense; intention killing \+ insanity).*

Justification is: I did A, and it was right/permissible/sensible in the circumstances. Responsibility is accepted, but wrongfulness is denied.

Excuse is: A was bad, but it’s not fair to attribute full responsibility to the actor (influence, accident, slip, impairments, etc.).

**Deadly force includes force used in a way that the actor knowingly** creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.

**Under the MPC, kidnapping and rape are triggers for deadly defensive force**, but the MPC treats robbery primarily under defense of property and tends to limit deadly force more strictly there.

**Self-defense, especially deadly self-defense, requires necessity** in a strong sense. There must be a threat (actual or apparent) of deadly force against the defender. The threat must be unlawful and immediate. The defender must believe they are in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that their response is necessary to save themself. The belief must be honestly held (subjective), and objectively reasonable in the circumstances. United States v. Peterson.

**Under the MPC, for deadly force, the defendant need only show they believed** deadly force was necessary to protect against death/serious bodily injury/kidnapping/forcible sexual intercourse. If the belief was formed recklessly or negligently, liability tracks that culpability level (e.g., reckless/negligent homicide instead of murder).

* ***Under the MPC, if belief is formed recklessly/negligently**, justification is unavailable for offenses where recklessness/negligence suffices.*

**NY allows the use of deadly force if a person reasonably believes it is necessary** to defend against imminent death or serious bodily harm, but the belief must be objectively reasonable. People v. Goetz.

**In CA, the reasonable person standard does not incorporate** a defendant’s unique susceptibility to inaccurate perception. People v. Brady.

**Under CA, a homicide is justified in perfect self-defense** if the defendant actually and reasonably believed deadly force was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily injury. People v. Elmore.

**Under CA, for imperfect self-defense, if the defendant actually believed in the need** to use deadly force but that belief was objectively unreasonable, malice is negated and the offense is reduced to voluntary manslaughter. People v. Flannel. **Even though reasonableness is objective, jurors must evaluate it from the perspective of a reasonable person** in the defendant’s situation with similar knowledge—considering all circumstances as known and appearing to the defendant. People v. Humphrey.

Under NJ self-defense law, force is justified only when the actor reasonably believes it is immediately necessary to protect against unlawful force, death, or serious bodily harm. State v. Kelly. 

Courts often accept battering-effects evidence in spouse/partner contexts, and sometimes in abused-child-who-kills-parent contexts, but these are not uniform.
