**The MPC for duress demands an objective standard with subjective elements**. The objective test is what a person of reasonable firmness would do while allowing the defendant’s circumstances to inform this standard. Factors like age, size, and health are considered but not individual temperament. 

Duress under CL requires a threat of harm that is present, imminent, and pending. The threat must induce well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm. The apprehension must be sufficient to overcome a person of ordinary fortitude. State v. Toscano.

* *generally threats to property/economic harm are usually insufficient; threats of future harm often trigger a duty to escape/seek authorities; threats can be to another person (often near relative) if other requirements met; traditional exception is that there is no duress defense to killing an innocent*

CL duress elements: there must be a threat typically death or serious bodily harm; the timing must be present, imminent, and impending; objective standard when measuring fear that a person of ordinary fortitude/courage might yield to; if the threat is future, defendant generally has a duty to escape or seek law enforcement; the threat must be directed at the claimant or close relative to them.

Duress is an affirmative defense when the defendant acted because of coercion by the use or threat of unlawful force against self or another; and a person of reasonable firmness in the defendant’s situation would have been unable to resist. 

* *Severity (death/SBI), immediacy, and the crime charged are evidential factors, not absolute gatekeeping requirements.* 

**Under the MPC, there is no duress defense** if the defendant recklessly (or negligently when negligence is enough for the culpability of the offense charged) put themselves in a situation where it was probably they’d face duress.

**In CA, a duress defense applies to persons** (unless the crime is punishable with death) who acted under threats or menaces sufficient to show they had reasonable cause to and did believe their lives would be endangered if they refused.

* *duress applies when, because of threat/menace, defendant reasonably believed their (or someone else’s) life was in immediate danger if they refused a demand (express or implied)*  
* *future harm is not enough; danger must be immediate*

**Duress is not a defense to murder and cannot** reduce murder to manslaughter. People v. Anderson (85 Cal. App. 4th 565).

**Under CL, duress is typically not a defense to murder, but under the MPC duress can** be a complete defense even for homicide. NJ post-Toscano statute—successful duress reduces murder to manslaughter.

**AZ applies an objective standard for duress**, focusing on whether a reasonable person of firmness would have resisted the threats, without regard to the defendant’s subjective psychological characteristics. 

* ***Evidence of a defendant’s personal experiences, such as IPV, is generally inadmissible** in the context of the objective duress defense, as it does not align with the reasonable person standard.* State v. Richter.  
* ***The Ninth Circuit precedent is that evidence of BWS can be admitted** to provide context for the defendant’s perception of threat and response to coercion, even when applying an objective standard.* United States v. Lopez.  
* ***The Tenth Circuit rejected evidence of PTSD to support a duress defense**; reasoning that allowing PTSD evidence would undermine the objective framework of the reasonable person standard.* United States v. Dixon.

**In NJ, the duress defense is assessed by whether a person of reasonable firmness** in the defendant’s situation would have been unable to resist the threat, using an objective standard that excludes the defendant’s personal psychological characteristics.

* ***BWS evidence is admissible but limited to countering** an inference of recklessness*.

**MPC bars duress if the defendant recklessly** (or sometimes negligently) placed themselves where duress was probable. United States v. Hernandez.
