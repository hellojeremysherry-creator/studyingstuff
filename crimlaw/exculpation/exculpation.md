Traditional excuses: *duress, intoxication, mental disorder*.

Excuse: disabling condition predicates every excuse defense; condition may be internal or external or temporary or permanent; involuntary actions demonstrating a true lack of willed bodily movements (e.g., reflex, convulsion); cognitive deficiencies impairing the ability to know the nature of conduct or whether it is right/wrong or legal/illegal; volitional deficiencies impairing the ability to make unencumbered choices or to meaningfully control behavior.
