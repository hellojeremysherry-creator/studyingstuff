Under CL, voluntary intoxication (VI) can negate specific intent; exclude it for general intent.

**Under CL and CA, VI is admissible to negate specific intent**; VI is not admissible to negate general intent. Crimes that require intent to achieve a further act (specific intent) may allow intoxication as a defense, while general intent crimes, which involve only the intent to commit the basic act, generally do not. 

* *Assault with a deadly weapon is classified as a general intent crime, meaning VI does not excuse intent.* People v. Hood.  
* *Specific intent assaults: assault with intent to rap or intent to kill.*

**In NJ, VI evidence is not admissible to negate mens rea for specific/general intent** crimes (with limited exception noted for FDM-type issues). State v. Stasio.

* premeditation/deliberation: VI may show these are not proven, which affects degrees of murder (e.g., may block elevation to first-degree)  
* fixed insanity: VI evidence it produces a fixed state of insanity may be relevant  
* participation/actus reus: VI may show defendant was unconscious or otherwise did not participate

**In CA, VI evidence is admissible solely to decide**: whether the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, or in murder cases, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought (intent to kill).

**In NJ, more aligned with the MPC, may consider VI evidence** for the purpose or knowledge requirements, but not for recklessness or negligence.

**In CA, VI is admissible only to show the defendant actually formed** required specific intent, or in murder: premeditation/deliberation or express malice (intent to kill); it is not admissible to negate implied malice.

Under the MPC, VI can negate purpose/knowledge but cannot negate recklessness if the actor would’ve perceived the risk while sober (and doesn’t help with negligence, which uses an objective sober standard).

VI evidence is irrelevant and not admissible to simple assault (e.g., general intent offenses, assaulting a federal officer), but VI evidence may be relevant and admissible to offenses requiring specific intent (e.g., specific intent to impede). United States v. Veach.

* *general intent offenses → VI evidence excluded*  
* *specific intent element (intent to impede) → VI evidence may be admissible*

MPC focuses on which mens rea level is required (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence). If P or K is required, VI evidence may likely be admissible to disprove those states of mind.

**If VI causes a permanent condition that satisfies** legal insanity standards (e.g., substantial incapacity to appreciate criminality or conform conduct), it can be treated like mental disease (settled insanity logic). But if VI causes only temporary insanity-like incapacity, it is not a defense. State v. Booth.
