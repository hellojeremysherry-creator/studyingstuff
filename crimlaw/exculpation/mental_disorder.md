Insanity; competence; execution

Duress: I’m like everyone else; circumstances made me do it.  
Insanity: I’m NOT like everyone else; mental disorder makes ordinary blame inappropriate.

Insanity, legal term, is a mental state at the time of the crime that precludes responsibility.  
Incompetence, legal term, is the inability to understand or participate in the legal process (trial, plea, sentencing, execution). 

**Competency is established if the defendant** has sufficient present ability to consult with counsel with reasonable rational understanding, and rational and factual understanding of proceedings. Dusky v. United States.

**In order to forcibly medicate an incompetent defendant** to make them competent for trial, the court must find important governmental interest in prosecution, medication will likely restore competency and will unlikely impair the defendant’s ability to assist counsel, less intrusive alternatives unlikely to work, medication is in the defendant's best medical interest. Sell v. United States.

**In some JDXs, total amnesia about the crime does not automatically** mean incompetent if otherwise functional. State v. Bruhn; State v. Decato. 

**Competence/sanity for execution** (Eighth Amendment): bars execution of the “insane.” Ford v. Wainwright.

**Competence to be executed requires at least a rational understanding** of the reason for execution, not mere awareness. Panetti v. Quarterman.

**Memory loss alone does not bar execution unless** combined with other deficits that prevent comprehension of why the state is exacting death. Madison v. Alabama.

**Presumption of sanity**. Insanity defense requires proof that, due to “disease of the mind,” the defendant had a defect of reason such that: (1) did not know the nature and quality of the act; or (2) knew it but did not know the act was wrong. M’Naghten.

**Some JDXs apply MPC-style formulations that focus on “substantial capacity” and the ALI test**. The MPC rejects responsibility if, due to mental disease/defect, lacked substantial capacity either to: appreciate criminality/wrongfulness, or conform conduct to law (volitional prong). Blake v. United States.

In United States v. Lyons, the court withdrew recognition of the volitional prong, instead they ruled insanity only if, due to mental disease/defect, the defendant is unable to appreciate wrongfulness of conduct (cognitive-only).

**Federal insanity defense**: affirmative defense only if, due to severe mental disease/defect, defendant was unable to appreciate: nature and quality or wrongfulness; mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.
