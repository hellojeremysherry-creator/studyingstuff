**Necessity is a choice between evils created by circumstances** (threatened/actual assault plus fear of reprisal), not a person forcing the specific act of escape through immediate coercion (compulsion/duress: coercion by threat of imminent physical harm that overbears the will). People v. Unger.

**CA is more rigid, requiring escape-necessity limits**—necessity for escape should go to the jury only where: (1) there exists a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack, or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future; no time for complaints to authorities or history of futile complaints; no force/violence toward third-parties in the escape; once safe, immediate reports to proper authorities. People v. Lovercamp.

Some JDXs have an imminence requirement for retreat: clear and imminent danger or imminent injury about to occur as an emergency measure.
