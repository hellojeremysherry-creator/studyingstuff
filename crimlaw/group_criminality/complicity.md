**Complicity is typically not a separate offense**; it’s a theory of liability for the substantive crime.

In the context of accomplice liability, both the intent to aid or encourage and the actual aiding or encouragement of the crime are necessary elements to satisfy a murder conviction. Hicks v. United States.

In State v. Gladstone, the defendant Gladstone was accused of aiding and abetting a cannabis sale by providing directions to a buyer—raising questions about the nexus between the defendant’s actions and the crime. 

**Whoever commits or aids/abets/counsels/commands/induces/procures** is punishable as a principal. Whoever willfully causes an act to be done (that would be an offense if done directly) is punishable as a principal. 

**Conspiracy is an agreement between** 2+ to commit a crime. It is both a separate crime, and in some JDXs, a basis for liability for con-conspirators’ substantive crimes (e.g., *Pinkerton*\-style liability: crimes in furtherance \+ reasonably foreseeable).

**Contrast to accomplice liability**: conspiracy-based derivative liability may reach acts the defendant did not intend (but were foreseeable).

**If an accomplice and principal are guilty of the same crime**, they have the same penalty range.

Mens rea of the principal for the substantive offense.  
Mens rea of the accomplice for their assistance/encouragement.

**Accomplice liability usually requires a true purpose or specific intent** to further the crime—i.e., not mere knowledge that help might assist wrongdoing.

**Intent to encourage is required**. Mere presence (or presence with an unneeded readiness to help) cannot be bootstrapped without evidence of a common plan. 

**Aider/abettor liability requires** words/acts used with the intention of encouraging/assisting the principal. Mere presence at the scene, without more (and without proof of a prior plan), is not enough. Hicks v. United States.

*Hicks* alternative facts: 

1. Hicks goes along to enjoy the spectacle…*likely not accomplice liability if he does nothing to aid/encourage and isn’t there as backup; mere presence plus bad thoughts typically does not mean aiding/abetting.*  
2. Hicks shouts encouragement…*stronger case for accomplice liability because it’s affirmative encouragement; the key question is whether the encouragement occurred with the intent to encourage*.  
3. Hicks resolves to make certain the principal succeeds by helping if it’s necessary…*this targets the idea of ready backup; liability depends on whether that readiness is communicated or otherwise actually functions as aid (or is part of an agreed plan)*.  
4. Hicks explicitly tells Rowe he will help if it’s necessary…*this is strong because the communication demonstrates willingness that can embolden the principal; the communication can be the aid/assurance furthering the commission of the crime*.

**There must be a nexus between accomplice and principal’s wrongdoing**. Aiding and abetting requires more than pointing out someone who might commit a crime. The defendant must associate themselves with the criminal venture in question, participate as something the defendant wishes to bring about, and seek by the defendant’s conduct to make it succeed.

**Aiding/abetting requires purposive participation** in the principal’s crime—not mere knowledge and not mere information-sharing unless it is done in a way that intentionally furthers the principal’s offense.  

**The MPC allows liability where the defendant aids/attempts to aid even if** the principal does not commit the offense (often treated through attempt principles). The accomplice must act with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the crime.

**Courts often look for facts showing: coordination**, endorsement/encouragement, facilitation beyond what a utilizer could easily do alone, or benefits to the alleged accomplice.

**To establish an aiding and abetting offense**, defendants must actively participate in the predicate crime (an element of the criminal conduct in question), and have advanced knowledge that a cohort will satisfy that element—knowledge early enough to allow withdrawal. They need knowledge of a material element of the crime.

**The majority says intent to facilitate is required**, but also says intent can be satisfied by active participation plus full knowledge of offense circumstances. 

**Courts may infer advance-knowledge from continued participation**, but the majority insists the government must show knowledge came early enough to matter. Courts think about timing, opportunity to withdraw, and practical risk in backing out.

**NY’s criminal facilitation model is a compromise**. There’s a lesser (2d degree) offense for aid without a true purpose to promote the crime. A defendant must believe it probable they are rendering aid to someone who intends to commit a Class A felony, they provide means/opportunity, and it in fact aids commission. 

**For money laundering (federal)**: financial transaction knowing it is designed to conceal/disguise proceeds of unlawful activity; transactions greater than 10k with criminal proceeds requires knowledge of illegal source and is broader in some ways; willful blindness can satisfy knowledge.

**In CA, to establish aiding and abetting**, the defendant must know the perpetrator’s unlawful purpose, and intend to commit, encourage, or facilitate the commission of the offense, and by act or advice, aid, promote, encourage or instigate the criminal activity in question.
