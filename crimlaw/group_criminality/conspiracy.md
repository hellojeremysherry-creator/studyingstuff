**Conspiracy as an inchoate offense** is an agreement between 2+ people to commit a crime. Punishable even if the target crime is never attempted or completed. No merger (unlike attempt), conspiracy is typically punishable in addition to the substantive offense if the substantive offense occurs. 

**Conspiracy as a form of accessory (group) liability**, separate from the inchoate offense, can be used to hold conspirators liable for substantive crimes committed by co-conspiratorys, even when the defendant didn’t aid/abet the particular act. Pinkerton.

**Attempt requires a substantial step**; conspiracy can attach at the moment of agreement.

**Under CA law, some otherwise non-criminal objectives are criminalized** under conspiracy (e.g., criminalizing agreements to do acts “injurious” to public morals, etc.).

**A member of a conspiracy can be held vicariously** liable for substantive offenses committed by other conspirators, provided those offenses were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and were reasonably foreseeable. Criminal liability for conspiracy extends beyond direct participation, emphasizing the collaborative nature of conspiratorial agreements. Pinkerton v. United States.

* *A conspirator is vicariously liable for the actors of co-conspirators if (1) the acts were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and (2) were within the scope of the unlawful agreement or reasonably foreseeable as part of the conspiracy’s objectives.*  
* *Liability continues until the conspirator affirmatively withdraws from the conspiracy, as mere passive disengagement is insufficient.*

The MPC’s rejection of Pinkerton underscores a preference for limiting liability to direct participation and intentional assistance of substantive criminal conduct. 

**Conspirators are vicariously liable for substantive** crimes committed by co-conspirators if the crimes were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the conspiracy, even if not part of the conspirator’s specific intent.

Joining a conspiracy can make prior acts admissible/evidentiary in proving conspiracy, but Pinkerton does not make you liable for substantive crimes committed before you joined.

A true purpose (specific intent) is generally required to hold a person liable as an accomplice; that is, an accomplice must actually intend their actions to further the criminal action or conduct of the principal. In People v. Lauria the court addressed under what circumstances a supplier who knowingly furnishes goods or services to criminals can be considered a co-conspirator. The court held that Lauria’s awareness that his answering service was used by prostitutes was insufficient to establish conspiracy because there was no evidence of Lauria’s specific intent to further the criminal enterprise, nor did Lauria take any direct steps to support the prostitute’s illegal activities. 

* *Direct or inferential proof of a stake in the venture is required for conspiracy; consider factors that may reveal a special interest in the criminal enterprise: financial stake, illegitimate product or service, or unusually high volume of sales.*

Murder as foreseeable in drug conspiracies: court affirms Pinkerton murder convictions for non-shooters based on large money/drugs, inference that weapons would be present, foreseeability of deadly force to protect interests/resist arrest, plus some evidence of knowledge/armed participation. United States v. Alvarez.

* *To convict, the government must prove the conspiracy existed, the defendant knew the essential objective, the defendant intentionally joined (even if late, even if minor role)*.

**Conspiracy and parallel conduct/actions**: coordinated agreement and parallel independent action; whether an agreement exists; whether there is a coordinating hub creating interdependence that effectively constitutes/infers agreement; tacit agreement can be inferred if the facts demonstrate an implicit shared plan; evidence beyond affiliation is needed—signals, coordinated positioning, shared weapons plan, prior discussions, or actions suggesting mutual commitment.

**Overt act requirement**: requires any act to effectuate the object—often extremely minimal; shows conspiracy is at work not just in minds; ***overt act ≪ attempt substantial step***.

**Some states require a substantial overt act**, closer to attempt standards. Some require a substantial step and even exclude speech alone.

**MPC’s justification for a low threshold**: agreement is concrete/less equivocal than attempt preparations; agreement that would become complicity if the crime occurs should not be non-criminal merely because the crime did not occur; group combo increases likelihood psychologically and practically.

**Intent to participate (conspiracy) can be shown by** direct evidence of intent to further the crime, or inference from circumstances showing (a) special interest / stake in the criminal venture, or (b) aggravated nature of the crime itself. People v. Lauria.

MPC and most states require purpose for conspiracy and accomplice liability.

**Attendant circumstances in conspiracies** (the context or conditions surrounding the conduct) may involve strict liability or lower mens rea requirements.

* *If the enhancement is SL, conspirators can be convicted even without knowledge of the circumstances.*   
* *Because conspiracy is an agreement to commit the crime, it makes sense to require at least knowledge/intent that the aggravating circumstance will exist—especially since conspiracy attaches so early.*
