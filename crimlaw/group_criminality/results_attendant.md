**Conduct elements** (the “doing”); **results elements** (what happens—death, injury, etc.); **attendant circumstances** (status/conditions—victim’s age, defendant’s felon status, etc.).

**The accomplice must intend/have purpose to promote** or facilitate the principal’s conduct (the venture). But for the result element, **the accomplice need only have the culpability** the substantive offense requires for that result (recklessness/negligence/malice-as-recklessness), not purpose to bring about the result.

**Under CL, an accomplice/accessory can be liable** for an unintentional-result offense (like negligent manslaughter) if they intentionally promote the underlying dangerous conduct, and their own mental state toward the risk/result meets what the substantive offense requires (e.g., recklessness/gross negligence). State v. McVay.

**Accomplice liability in reckless or malicious acts**: accomplice liability can extend to crimes requiring malice or recklessness if the accomplice shared the intent to participate in conduct that created the danger that led to the offense. 

* *Accomplice liability for crimes involving reckless or malicious acts is based on a shared intent to support conduct that poses substantial risks.*

**Intent to facilitate dangerous conduct**: the mens rea for accomplice liability does not require intent to cause a specific result element (such as death) in unintentional crimes; it is sufficient that the defendant intended to assist the dangerous conduct that led to the result. Commonwealth v. Roebuck.

**Knowledge requirement for accomplice liability**: for aiding and abetting possession of a firearm by a felon, the accomplice must know or have reason to know of the principal’s felon status.

* *Accomplice liability requires knowledge of the principal’s criminal status or circumstances constituting the offense, **unless the underlying criminal offense imposes strict liability** where the accomplice may be liable without knowledge of certain material elements of the crime.* **United States v. Canon**.

**Intent to assist in commission of the crime**: accomplice liability requires that the defendant intentionally supports or facilitates the commission of a known crime, including knowledge of any critical/material elements. United States v. Gardner.

**Under the MPC, accomplice liability requires a purpose to promote/facilitate** the commission of the crime (focuses on conduct). For result elements, accomplice liability requires the accomplice to have the required culpability toward the result.

* *When causing a particular result is an element, an accomplice in the conduct causing the result is an accomplice in the offense if they act with culpability toward that result sufficient for the offense.*  
* *An accomplice/accessory can be liable for an unintentional-result offense (like negligent manslaughter) if they intentionally promote the underlying dangerous conduct, and their own mental state toward the risk/result meets what the substantive offense requires (e.g., recklessness/gross negligence).* 

**The MPC is explicitly undecided whether the accomplice’s purpose must extend** to attendant circumstances. Courts must decide whether for a circumstance element the accomplice needs: purpose/knowledge as to the circumstance, or only the same mens rea required of the principal for that circumstance (including strict liability).

**Looking at Rosemond, the drug transaction is the core conduct**, and the gun presence/use is treated like an attendant circumstance of an armed drug transaction.

**Attempt: MPC is more demanding**—often requires purpose or belief re result even if completed offense only needs recklessness/negligence.  
**Complicity: for results, accomplice needs only** the completed-offense mens rea—McVay; Roebuck; MPC).

**Completed harm increases blame/retaliatory impulse**; and complicity is tied to an actual offense occurring. Attempt law is designed to avoid overpunishing when harm doesn’t happen and to limit criminalization to more clearly culpable aims.

**MPC is less demanding for attempt (uses mens rea of completed** crime for circumstances), but is cautious/ambiguous for complicity—because accomplice liability can otherwise sweep very broadly (e.g., strict liability circumstance \+ minimal assistance).

**Community of purpose can exist in mutually dangerous activity**; accepting each other’s challenge to engage in extremely dangerous conduct that creates a grave and substantial risk for causing significant bodily harm/injury; shared venture and jointly creating a zone of danger. People v. Russell; People v. Abbott.

Where multiple defendants intentionally participate in a course of dangerous joint conduct, and each acts with the requisite culpable mental state of recklessness evincing depraved indifference to human life, each such defendant may be deemed legally accountable for the resulting death, even in circumstances where the specific actor who caused fatality can be ascertained. People v. Russell

**Natural and Probable Consequence**: accomplice intends to aid one crime, but is liable for additional crimes committed by the principal if they were reasonably foreseeable/natural and probably consequences of the aided crime.

**MPC limits accomplice liability to offenses within the accomplice’s shared purposes**, using probabilities only as evidence of what the accomplice intended—not as an independent basis to convict.

**An accomplice cannot be convicted of first-degree premeditated murder** under the natural and probable consequences doctrine because first-degree murder’s mens rea requirement—deliberation and premeditation to kill—is a uniquely subjective and personal mental state. People v. Chiu.

* Natural and probable means what ensues in the ordinary course of events—a reasonable predictable outcome, not merely conceivable. It must be within a reasonably predictable range in the ordinary course, without intervening factors. Roy v. United States.

**Under CL**, if encouragement/aiding is not actually communicated/received or has no effect, no accomplice liability (attempt to aid does not necessarily function as aiding).

**Complicity by omission under the MPC** states that accomplice liability is satisfied if the defendant has a legal duty to prevent the offense, and fails to act with the purpose of promoting/facilitating the crime.

Where an essential element is supplied only by a feigned participant acting without criminal intent, and the defendant doesn’t personally commit that element, accomplice/derivative liability fails (though the defendant may be guilty of other offenses they personally completed).
