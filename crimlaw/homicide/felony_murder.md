**California’s Felony-Murder Rule (FMR)**: a defendant is strictly liable for any deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if the death is accidental or unforeseeable. 

“Take Your Victim as You Find Him” Rule: The defendant is responsible for the death of the victim even if the victim had a pre-existing condition that contributed to the death.

**There must be a direct causal link between the felony** and the death for the felony-murder rule to apply. King’s plane crash killed his co-pilot but was not directly caused by the commission of the felony (trafficking cannabis), but caused by poor weather conditions and other factors outside of the felony committed. On the other hand, Stamp’s victim was the owner/manager of the store Stamp was robbing. Stamp told the owner/manager to get on the ground. The owner/manager had pre-existing heart issues; substantial hypertension resulting  from moving to the ground, and the adrenaline of being robbed, etc. The owner/manager died from cardiac arrest shortly after the robbery took place. For the *Stamp* court, this was directly linked enough to the felonious act to constitute a felony muder conviction.

***Stamp***: The felony operated directly on the victim. The felony created immediate lethal stress. Death was a direct causal link (even if unforeseeable). The victim’s fragility does not constitute a superseding cause.

***King***: The felony was incidental-background. The felony (trafficking cannabis) did not increase the risk of death (crashing); independent factors played a significant causal role over the operation of the felonious act.

***King*** **and *Stamp***: The felony must contribute to the mechanism of death, not merely the occasion for it. *Felony murder requires that the felony actively contribute to the physiological or physical mechanisms of death, not merely place the victim in a scenario where death may later occur.*

**In CA, for a felony to serve as a basis/predicate for felony murder**, it must be inherently dangerous to life in the abstract, meaning it must carry a high risk/probability of death. The dangerousness is determined based on the statutory definition of the felony itself, not the way it was committed. 

**In *Phillips*, the defendant**, a Chiropractor, told the family of an eight-year girl suffering from a fast-growing cancer not to allow the recommended surgery to remove the girl’s eye and that he could cure her with his treatment plan. He charged the family for $700 for his services. The girl later died as a result of the untreated cancer. The *Phillips* court reasoned that grand theft, including theft by deception, does not meet the standard because it is not generally dangerous to human life. Distinguishing this from *Stamp*, robbery is an inherently dangerous act that carries a higher (much higher) probability / risk of death than grand theft by deception which is not quite inherently dangerous and carries a lower probability / risk of death. This factor adds a limitation to the FMR application; even if the felonious conduct directly relates / is mechanistic to facilitating the death (convincing a family not to take a certain medical treatment path), the act of grand theft by deception, unlike robbery, lacks the degree of inherent dangerousness and high-probability of death.

***Burroughs*** is doctrinally unstable under CA’s abstract-danger test because defining dangerousness by reference to risk of death collapses the abstract-danger inquiry into the homicide itself, defeating *Phillips*’s function as a limiting principle.

* Unintentional killing plus criminal negligence fits involuntary manslaughter.

Inherently dangerous is assessed in the abstract by looking at the elements of the felony, not the facts of the particular case.

Predicate felony not inherently dangerous…*Phillips*  
Statute’s danger defined by result is circular…*Burroughs*  
Predicate qualifies; causation satisfied…*Stamp*
