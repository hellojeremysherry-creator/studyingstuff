**Criminal Homicide Classification**. *CH is classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.*

**Malice Section 188\.** Express malice is a deliberate intent to unlawfully take life. Implied malice is conduct that demonstrates a malignant heart or abandonment of human life, without a direct intent to kill.

**PA Criminal Homicide Offense**. Criminal homicide is satisfied when a person intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of another human being.

**NY Homicide.** *The act of causing the death of another person, and it can include murder, manslaughter, or criminally negligent homicide. Manslaughter in the second-degree: recklessly causing death or aiding another in committing suicide. Manslaughter in the first-degree: intent to cause serious injury resulting in death, or killing under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.*

**MPC Criminal Homicide.** *Conceptualizes three categories: murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide.*

**Under CA law, second-degree murder** *requires either express or implied malice. IM exists when the defendant engages in conduct that shows a wanton disregard for human life.*

*Guthrie*; *Carroll*. 

No time is too short doctrine—intent to kill can form instantaneously before the fatal act, leading to first-degree conviction, even for spontaneous fatal acts—covers a large area of CL jurisdictions. *Carroll*.

**Rule (*Carroll*)**: the *Carroll* approach to premeditation: no time is too short for intent to form; any intentional killing is premeditated; reflection is not required; time element collapses. 

* **Rationale**: Avoids arbitrary distinctions between momentary thought vs. actual planning.

**Rule (*Guthrie*)**: premeditation requires some time (nearly any amount) to reflect and decide and decide to kill—not just instantaneous intent; *Guthrie* requires formation of intent before the act, opportunity for reflection, evidence of weighing a decision (though brief); spontaneous intentional killings may be considered second-degree, while first-degree is reserved for cold-blooded, calculating, or considered killings. 

* **Insight**: if intent alone equals premeditation, then 1st vs. 2nd-degree distinctions collapse.

Finding premeditation is contingent upon proof of reflection; in order to satisfy this requirement, Courts **follow the *Anderson* categories**: (1) planning activity before the fatal act; (2) purpose or reason to kill; (3) manner of the fatal act suggesting a preconceived design. 

* In *Forrest*, a mercy-killing father resulted in premeditated first-degree murder.

**CL Mental States for Malice**: *intent to kill (someone or different person), intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH), depraved indifference/extreme recklessness (conscious disregard of a known risk of death).*

**CL Grading Strategies**. ***Murder***: *express malice (intent to kill)*, implied malice (no provocation or abandoned and malignant heart). ***First-Degrees Murder***: *premeditated & deliberate killing, enumerated methods (poison, lying in wait, torture), felony murder (enumerated felonies).*

* **California**: *premeditation does not require meaningful reflection, felony-murder liability narrowed (major participant plus reckless indifference).*

**Pennsylvania (Mens Rea-Driven)**. *first-degree (intentional killing), second-degree (felony murder), third-degree (all other malice killings)*.

**New York (MPC-Influenced)**. *NY rejects premeditation as a grading device, shifting away from act-based labels toward culpability plus mitigation; murder (second-degree: intentional killing, depraved indifference, felony murder), mitigation (extreme emotional disturbance \- EED)*.

**MPC** rejects degrees of murder and premeditation-deliberation; murder: purposeful or knowing killing, or extreme recklessness; manslaughter: reckless killing or EED; negligent homicide: criminal negligence. ***MPC rationale***: impulse vs. deliberation is morally unreliable.

***Carroll*** **Approach (Majority)**. *Premeditation: can occur instantly, exist simultaneously with the act, essentially equals intent to kill. Result: collapses distinction between intent and premeditation.* Conduct may infer premeditation, psychiatric testimony is minimized, moral judgment reserved for court/jury, not doctors. 

**Guthrie Approach (Minority)**. *Premeditation: requires actual reflection, time for second thought, killing after contemplation. Rejects instantaneous premeditation, premeditation does not necessarily mean intent, preserves meaningful grading.*

**Provocation & Voluntary Manslaughter**. CL doctrine requirements: adequate provocation, heat of passion, no cooling time, causal connection. Traditional categories: serious assault, mutual combat, illegal arrest, injury to close relative, catching spouse in adultery.
