***Commonwealth v. Malone*****.** No intent to kill required. Malice can be shown by: intentional conduct, extremely high risk of death, or callous disregard for consequences.

**At CL, unintentional killings** could be classified as murder if they demonstrate malice (wicked, depraved, and malignant heart). **In MPC inspired statutes** often define murder as an unintentional killing committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.

Negligence → didn’t perceive the risk.  
Recklessness → perceived the risk, disregarded it.  
Malice / extreme indifference → perceived risk so severe that ignoring it is morally equivalent to intending death.

***State v. Fleming***: *Drunk, frenzied and rampageous driving endangering others, Fleming’s deliberate and egregiously dangerous driving inferred conduct that was reckless and wanton.* *Malice aforethought inferred from conduct demonstrating a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care. **Commonwealth v. Malone***: *Pulling the trigger three times in Russian “Roulette” is grossly reckless. Malice is defined as an act of gross recklessness, reasonably anticipating that death is likely to result.* 

Both common law and statutory law distinguish between manslaughter and unintentional murder based on the degree of recklessness and the presence of "extreme indifference to the value of human life." While the MPC omits the common-law language, it still leaves room for subjective judgment by the trier of fact. Courts have struggled with applying these distinctions, particularly in cases where the defendant's actions fall into a gray area between reckless manslaughter and murder.

Manslaughter includes unlawful acts causing unintentional death (e.g., traffic violations, abortion-drug administration), and lawful acts done with gross negligence causing death.
