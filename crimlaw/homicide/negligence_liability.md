Negligence: I created a risk I should have known about, but I didn’t.  
Recklessness: I knew about the risk and consciously disregarded it.

Didn’t know → negligence  
Knew → recklessness

Low / ordinary → civil or negligent homicide  
High → criminal recklessness  
Extremely high → murder (depraved indifference)

**Wanton/Reckless Conduct**. This standard requires more than just negligence. It involves a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that could lead to significant harm.

**Substantial and Unjustifiable Risk**. A risk that is serious enough that, considering all the circumstances, it involves a gross deviation from the standard of care expected.

***Welansky*** **and *Hall* evaluate** whether certain conduct could or should be considered reckless. Recklessness requires a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that could lead to significant harm. A risk that is serious enough that, considering all the circumstances, it involves a gross deviation from the standard of care expected. Both Welansky and Hall created substantial and unjustifiable risks from conduct so reckless that it demonstrated a disregard for the probable consequence. Both Hall and Welansky knew or should have been aware of the risks they created, given Hall’s knowledge and training as a ski racer, and Welansky’s role as the manager of the nightclub.

**In *State v. Williams*, Washington law allowed** manslaughter to be based on ordinary negligence. The court reasoned that while the Williamses were ignorant of the full severity of their child’s illness, they had ample notice of the child’s worsening condition, including persistent symptoms like swelling and fussiness. Their fear of the welfare department intervening did not excuse their duty to seek medical care. The failure to exercise ordinary caution in seeking help when the child's condition was clearly worsening was sufficient to constitute negligence.
