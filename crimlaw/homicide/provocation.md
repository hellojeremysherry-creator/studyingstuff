**Issue-Spotting Checklist**: *Intentional killing? Evidence of emotional disturbance? Source of disturbance: victim conduct or long-term trauma? Timing: immediate, smoldering, or rekindled? JDX: CL categorical, flexible CL, or MPC/EED? Objective filter: ordinary person, defendant’s situation?*

***Girouard v. State*** **(CL Provocation)**. *Words alone are never legally adequate provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter.*

**CL Doctrine Structure.** *To reduce murder to manslaughter, the defendant must show adequate provocation (as a matter of law), actual heat of passion, no cooling time, causal connection between provocation and killing.*  

* ***Girouard*** **(CL Majority).** ***Categories of adequate provocation:*** *serious assault or battery, mutual combat, illegal arrest, injury to close relative, sudden discovery of spouse’s adultery.*

**People v. Casassa (MPC / EED)**. *Murder may be mitigated if the defendant acted under extreme emotional disturbance (EED) for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. Two elements:*

* **Subjective:** *whether the defendant actually experienced EED; focuses on the defendant’s state of mind.*  
* **Objective:** *whether there is a reasonable explanation for that disturbance; judged from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation, as the defendant believed circumstances to be; this introduces an objective standard to ensure that the emotional disturbance is not purely idiosyncratic.* 

**MPC’s EED standard** *does not require a specific provocation or immediate reaction; allows for defense on prolonged stress and emotional turmoil, without requiring a triggering event immediately before the crime.*

***Girouard*** **and *Casassa* reflect different fears**: *Girouard* fears jury bias and domestic violence normalization; *Casassa* fears limitless mitigation through psychology. So each builds a gatekeeping mechanism: *Girouard*’s categorical exclusion; *Casassa*’s objective reasonableness backstop.  

**Hypo:**  
A defendant kills his terminally ill parent after months of watching intense suffering, believing (reasonably but mistakenly) that death was the only way to end the pain.

**Question:**  
Under Casassa / MPC EED, is this categorically barred the way Girouard bars words-alone provocation — or is it at least eligible for mitigation?

The court evaluates whether a reasonable person in the defendant’s situation, as they believed it to be, could experience such an EED \- not whether the killing itself was reasonable. 

**Premeditation and Deliberation**. These elements require that the defendant formed the intent to kill after weighing the decision, even if for a short time, and then acted with a conscious and deliberate intent. *Forrest* addresses the issue of mercy killings and emphasizes that compassion does not negate premeditation and deliberation. If the defendant had time to reflect on the decision to kill and acted with deliberate intent, the legal elements of premeditation and deliberation can still be met.

Typically “mercy killing” manifests a well-formed, calculated and deliberated plan with the result being the actor’s conscious objective. The MPC approach to EED does not require a specific provocation or immediate reaction. Instead it allows for a defense based on prolonged mental trauma that may result in a delayed, seemingly unprovoked violent act.
