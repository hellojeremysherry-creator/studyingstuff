Common Law: *intentionally, willfully, maliciously, recklessly, negligently, scienter, general/specific intent*.

MPC Modern Framework: *Purpose (conscious object to cause the result or engage in the conduct); Knowledge (aware that a result is practically certain); Reckless (conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk); Negligence (should have been aware of the risk; a reasonable person would have noticed).*

Deliberate ignorance equals knowledge. *Jewell*. 

* Jewell drives a car with a secret cannabis compartment. He suspected it but avoided checking.

Knowledge measures whether the actor was aware that a certain result would occur. Recklessness measures whether the actor, aware of what their conduct will likely result in, willingly ignored that risk, and acted anyway. I could be wrong here but I feel like you may have recklessness without knowledge (e.g., recklessly crossing over lanes, getting into an accident and substantially injuring their passenger, but done so without practical certainty that the accident would substantially injure the passenger), but you may not be able to satisfy the knowledge element without recklessness. I feel like it’s a lot less common to have knowledge without recklessness than it is to have recklessness without knowledge.

* Knowledge requires awareness of practical certainty.  
* Recklessness requires awareness of a substantial risk, but not the certainty aspect.

**Knowledge does not always imply recklessness, because recklessness also requires unjustifiability.** *A surgeon performs a dangerous but medically necessary operation knowing the patient will likely die. The risk is substantial, but not unjustifiable, so it’s not reckless.*

* If a defendant is aware a result is practically certain, and proceeds because they believe they are justified, they act *knowingly but not necessarily recklessly*.

**Under Common Law (CL),** malice requires either an actual intent to do the particular kind of harm that in fact occurred, or recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not. *Cunningham*.

* Malice requires foresight of the harmful consequence – not just moral wrongdoing or involvement in a separate felony.   
* Malice is: *“I want to do it, and I have a goal to do it, and regardless of risks, I’m going to do it.”*

Faulkner intended to steal the rum. Faulkner did not intend to commit arson. Arson is not within the category of risks when the intention is to steal. Faulkner disregarded the risks that come with stealing, and not the risks that come with committing arson.
