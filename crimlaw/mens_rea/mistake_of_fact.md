**Under CL, mistake of fact is a defense only if it negates the mens rea the statute actually requires**. Courts sometimes treat certain elements (typically aggravating ones) as strict liability unless the statute says otherwise.

* If the aggravating circumstance only increases the penalty and the statute is silent, courts often impose strict liability for that circumstance. *State v. Benniefield*.   
* If the aggravating fact is tightly tied to the wrongfulness of the act, courts tend to require mens rea. *Flores-Figueroa v. United States*.  
* Dangerous acts often trigger strict liability enhancement even with accidental results. *Dean v. United States*.

CL is sometimes focused on fairness, but also willing to override fairness in certain categories (sex offenses, minors, public welfare) by the moral-wrong or lesser-crime principles.  
MPC states are purely focused on fairness. There are no special doctrines; an MOF is a defense whenever it negates the mens rea required for a material element of the crime. No moral-wrong or lesser-crime principles.
