**In an MPC world**, strict liability (SL) offenses are classified as violations (under the casebook text) and not crimes \- SL violations can only result in fines or civil penalties rather than criminal penalties e.g., incarceration or probation, as MPC 2.05 mandates. The MPC’s general provision is that criminal penalties should not be imposed without proving some level of culpability (purpose/intent, knowledge). We see this aligns with *State v. Guminga* where the court struck down the Minnesota statute because it allowed vicarious criminal liability that could lead to imprisonment for a crime the employer *Guminga* neither committed nor had knowledge of. The reasoning emphasizes that personal liberty cannot be compromised without fault being proven. 

**Common law (CL)** does not restrict SL to violations. For instance, in public welfare offenses SL can carry criminal penalties. Examples include *Balint*, *Dotterweich*, and many regulatory offenses. CL tests are more complex and rely heavily on statutory interpretation \+ legislative intent. At CL, SL crimes are possible, though limited by due process concerns, the *Morissette* presumptions of mens rea, whether an offense looks like a public welfare/regulatory offense, or penalty severity in *Staples*. 

**We saw the Supreme Court (SC) in *Morissette* reverse** the conversion-of-government-property call on Morissette, the junk dealer who took bomb casings from government property. The court reasoned that mens rea was required for such a call, even though the statute codifying the call was silent on the requisite mens rea element of intent. The SC distinguished between public welfare offenses (seen in *Balint* and *Dotterweich*) and CL crimes, which traditionally require mens rea. The SC here in *Morissette* reversing the call limits the application of SL \- asserting that mens rea is required for serious offenses involving theft and larceny \- and emphasizes the importance of intent in crimes against property. 

* **When a statute codifies a traditional CL crime** (e.g., larceny, theft, burglary, assault, etc.), courts presume a mens rea requirement, even if the statute says nothing. *Balint*, and *Dotterweigh* involve public welfare offenses, so courts are more willing to infer SL because the goal is regulatory safety, not punishing moral blameworthiness. 

**Key CL factors courts use (drawn from *Morissette*, *Staples*, *Balint*, *Dotterweich*, *X-Citement Video*)**.

* Factors Suggesting **Not**\-SL: (1) offense resembles a core CL crime; (2) severe penalties, especially felonies; (3) conduct is innocent in itself (e.g., gun possession, shipping videos); (4) widespread lawful activity (e.g., firearm ownership in *Staples*); (5) statute would criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct; (6) statute uses terms like “knowingly” even if placement is ambiguous (seen in *X-Citement Video*).  
* Factors Suggesting **Indeed**\-SL: (1) statute regulates dangerous or harmful items; (2) actor is in a responsible relation to a public danger (seen in *Dotterweich*); (3) penalties are relatively small / non-stigmatic; (4) conduct is not innocent (e.g., distributing narcotics); (5) enforcement would be impossible if mens rea were required; (6) legislature intended a regulatory scheme rather than moral condemnation.

The SL modern framework evolution: *Balint*, *Dotterweich*, *Morissette* and *Staples*.  
In *Balint* there was a statute saying that selling certain narcotics without proper order required under the Narcotics Act of 1914 is prohibited. Defendants argued that they did not know the substances were prohibited. The Supreme Court (SC) holds that the illegal nature of the substances is irrelevant and thus proving such knowledge of this illegal nature was not required. This ruling allowed SL to apply in situations where the public welfare is at risk; some regulatory offenses exist to protect public welfare and that it is more important to penalize those who harm the public, even if the violator is ignorant of the law. In short, *Dotterweich*’s rule supports and strengthens the *Balint* decision.

*Staples* says: if the penalty is harsh (felony) and the conduct is common/innocent, courts do NOT read the statute as SL unless Congress makes it crystal clear.   

In *X-Citement*, we saw the Court rule that the mens rea requirement extended to the age of the person depicted. This narrows the scope of SL \- requiring proof of MR for key elements of the offense \- and reinforces the principle that scienter (knowledge) should apply to all key elements of a crime (including facts that distinguish lawful from unlawful conduct). 

The Court in *United States v. Ruggiero* ruled that 18 U.S.C. § 2251 does not contain an express mens rea requirement regarding the age of the minor. The statute’s omission of this requirement indicates that Congress intended to impose strict liability for producing child pornography. The Court distinguished this case from distribution cases like *United States v. X-Citement Video*, Inc., where the Court required mens rea regarding the age of the minor. In production cases, the individual directly engages with the minor, making it reasonable to place the burden on the producer to determine the age of the person depicted.

*Guminga* establishes that a person cannot be subjected to criminal punishment for actions they did not personally commit, know about, or authorize. It protects individual liberty and due process rights by limiting the scope of criminal vicarious liability, reserving criminal punishment for those directly at fault; it reflects the principle that criminal liability should not be imposed without fault, especially when personal liberty is at stake. 

(C) is like *Guminga* as it allows vicarious criminal liability that could lead to imprisonment for a crime the person neither committed nor had knowledge of. Due process requires balancing public interest against intrusion on personal liberty, particularly when alternative penalties (e.g., civil fines or license suspension) exist. Criminal punishment is reserved for direct fault, while civil penalties can suffice for regulatory enforcement without violating constitutional protections.
