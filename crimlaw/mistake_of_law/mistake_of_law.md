**Mistake of Law**: *pure ignorance/misreading; mistake about a collateral legal status/relationship that is itself an element; official-reliance/entrapment by estoppel; due process “fair notice” limits for passive omissions*

**Pure Ignorance/Misreading of Criminal Prohibition**: I didn’t know this statute applied / I interpreted it differently.

**Mistake About Collateral Legal Status / Relationship (Elemental to Crime)**: I’m not sure whose property this is. Am I unlawfully present? Did I have authority of law?

**Official-Reliance / Entrapment by Estoppel**: I relied on an official statement/interpretation that turned out wrong.

**Due Process “Fair Notice” Limits for Passive Omissions (‘Failure-to-Register’ Type Laws)**: Absent actual knowledge or probability of knowledge when conduct is wholly passive, conviction can violate due process.

**Under the MPC, a mistake of fact or law is a defense if it negates the culpability** required for a material element (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence). Ignorance of the law defining the offense: no element of an offense is knowledge that the conduct is illegal unless the offense definition says so. **A defense is available where the actor relies** on an official statement of law (statute, judicial decision, administrative order, official interpretation) that is later determined invalid or erroneous.

**At CL, ignorance/misinterpretation of criminal law is no excuse**. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct based on a mistaken belief that their conduct is legal unless the mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law. People v. Marrero.

**If a crime requires proof of a specific intent to commit an unlawful act**, a good faith belief that one’s actions are authorized by law can negate the necessary intent and provide a valid defense. People v. Weiss.

**A police officer’s reasonable mistake of law can provide the reasonable suspicion** required to justify a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment allows a traffic stop based on reasonable suspicion, which can be grounded in a reasonable mistake of law or fact (MOL or MOF). Heien v. North Carolina. 

**A landlord cannot be convicted of theft if they have a good-faith belief** that they are legally entitled to the property, even if that belief is mistaken. A defendant who acts under a good-faith belief that they have a lawful claim to property lacks the intent to steal, which is a necessary element of theft. State v. Varszegi.

**For firearm possession under federal firearm law**, the government must prove that a defendant not only possessed a firearm but also knew of their prohibited status from doing so. Rehaif v. United States.

**At CL, if the crime requires a mental state about a circumstance that is partly legal** (ownership, authority, status), a good-faith mistake can negate mens rea, even if the mistake is “legal” in nature. (see Rehaif v. United States and the collateral law distinction).

**In CA, MOL is not a defense that the defendant did not know** they were breaking the law or believed the act was lawful. **MOF is a defense when the fact negates intent**; recognizes ignorance or mistake of fact can disprove criminal intent. For claim of right (COR), a good-faith belief you have a right to the specific property negates the required intent, and can extend to crimes like robbery. People v. Tufunga.

**Willfulness in criminal tax violations requires that the defendant knowingly** and intentionally violated a known legal duty. This defense is reasonable. The state has a duty to prove-up that the good faith belief is absurd. They have to demonstrate that the belief is just unreasonable. Cheek v. United States.

**A good-faith belief (cannot be a defense to a ‘willfulness’ charge)**, whether reasonable or not, that one is not violating tax laws negates willfulness if it shows a lack of knowledge of the legal duty. Beliefs about the unconstitutionality of the law are not a defense to willfulness because they reflect knowledge of the law, not a misunderstanding. Cheek.

**If a statute requires the actor to have knowledge of a policy or law** regarding certain prohibitory actions/authorization boundaries, then knowledge-of-illegality is necessary and proof is required that the actor knew the action was unauthorized. Liparota v. United States.

**Under federal firearm purchase law, the government must prove the defendant knowingly** made a false statement. Knowledge of the falsity of the statement is required, but a mistake about the legal definition of a term (such as “gift”) is not a valid defense. United States v. Karani.

* This is because the statute required only that the defendant knew they were not the true buyer. (Contrast to Cheek where complex tax laws required specific knowledge of legality).

**Official advice does not excuse; you act at your peril where statute’s application** is doubtful. Ignorance or MOL, even if based on advice from a public official, does not excuse criminal conduct. The law is paramount, and advice from an official does not override the statute’s authority. State v. Hopkins.

**Due process forbids convicting someone for conduct the government** affirmatively led them to believe was lawful, unless the reliance is unreasonable, or materially conflicts with federal law under a Supremacy Clause notion. Raley v. Ohio; United States v. Cox.

**For a law that imposes criminal liability based on inaction**, actual knowledge or the probability of knowledge of the law is necessary for a conviction to be constitutional. **A person cannot be convicted for failing to comply with a law** if they had no knowledge of it, especially where the offense is based on passive conduct (such as failing to register) and there is no indication the person should have been aware of the legal requirement. Lambert v. California.
