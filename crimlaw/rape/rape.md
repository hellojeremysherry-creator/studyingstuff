**Internal willingness model** (*consent is what the person actually felt \- willingness, tracks harm conceptually but can be about subjective states*); **Refusal-centered model** (*nonconsent shown by clear refusal \- consent can be inferred absent refusal depending on circumstances*); **Affirmative consent model** (*consent requires some affirmative permission \- “absence of permission”*); **MPC model** (*willingness and makes a clear verbal refusal dispositive of nonconsent*),  
Force, consent, coercion.

**Force-based regimes**: felony SA/R requires (a) penetration and (b) force/threat/coercion (often force beyond that inherent in penetration), and typically (c) non-consent at the moment of penetration.

**Non-consent-based regimes**: felony requires penetration without consent (force matters mostly for grading/sentencing).

**Fraud/deception regimes**: generally, fraud doesn’t equal rape unless it fits a narrow ‘fraud in factum / unconscious of nature of act / impersonation / professional purpose’ category. 

Two competing **baselines of what “force” means**:

* More than inherent or incidental to the sexual act itself…*Stevens*  
* A physical compulsion or threat of physical compulsion that causes submission.

The fight is often: whether the defendant’s conduct is “extra” force/coercion, or is just the physical mechanics of the act.

There are **key distinctions in how courts constitute “resistance”** (formal rule / reality):

* Some states require “reasonable” or “earnest” resistance.  
* Many states formally abolish resistance, but juries (and sometimes prosecutors) still look for it as proof of non-consent/force.

California repealed its statutory resistance requirement in *People v. Barnes* where the victim froze in fear. But even without a formal resistance requirement, a force requirement often functionally reintroduces resistance because it’s hard to prove “extra force” if the victim didn’t resist.  

**Many force JDXs accept “constructive force”** \- submission of fear produced by the defendant's conduct.

**CL doctrinal limit**: the fear generally must be reasonably grounded (objective reasonableness), not purely subjective.

**Some JDXs move toward subjective fear** (*State v. Brooks* in Kansas: fear is inherently subjective and lack of knowledge can be no defense).

**Nonphysical coercion (economic threats, humiliation threats)**. Some statutes expand beyond physical harm into threats of humiliation, financial loss, retaliation, etc. 

**But courts worry about**: line drawing (threat or offer; coercion or bargain), jury/prosecutor discretion and discrimination, and criminal law overreach into bad but common sexual bargaining. 

***State v. Rusk***…lack of consent can be shown by resistance or failure to resist due to fear; fear must be reasonably grounded to substitute for resistance; in a force statute, small physical acts can be the hook that turns a close case into sufficient evidence; courts require force causally connected to submission; immobilization does not mean compulsion unless it directly produces submission.

* Rusk took her keys and pressured her up to his apartment.  
* When she told Rusk that she should leave, Rusk said no and continued undressing and kissing her; and then she asked if she did what he wanted, would he let her go, Rusk said yes.  
* The key-taking alone failed not because it involved no physical act, but because it was not force directed at compelling sexual submission, and therefore did not satisfy the statute’s demand for force overcoming resistance or preventing resistance through reasonably grounded fear.

*Under force-based statutes, acts that restrict liberty may generate fear, but absent force contemporaneous with sexual submission, courts hesitate to treat such conduct as the force required to overcome resistance.*

***State v. DiPetrillo***…force or coercion can include psychological pressure in some contexts; even when conduct feels coercive, a statute that requires force/coercion that overcomes the victim can create a proof gap if the factfinder relied on a mix of factors and didn’t clearly find a qualifying one beyond a reasonable doubt.

***Commonwealth v. Torres***…constructive force: victim submits due to fear/intimidation created by defendant’s conduct; prosecution must elicit the circumstances and the impact on ability to resist; need moment-of-incident evidence tying defendant’s conduct to victim’s fear/submission.

***State v. Brooks***…victim-subjective direction and/or reduced emphasis on reasonableness.

***Commonwealth v. Mlinarich***…defines forcible compulsion narrowly; shows the physical violence boundary: physical force/violence or threat of physical force sufficient to prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution; rejects elastic definitions that would turn many economic/social threats into rape, emphasizing uncertainty and broad jury discretion.

***State in the interest of MTS***…SA occurs when penetration is done without affirmative, freely given permission; permission can be shown by words or actions under all circumstances; victim has no duty to resist or verbally refuse; silence/failure to protest is not justification.

* no force beyond penetration required; no resistance required; no fear analysis required; no “reasonable woman” inquiry; no temporal alignment problem; once the factfinder concludes affirmative permission, the act itself supplies the force.  
* this is a force statute interpreted into a consent statute

***State v. McFadden***…compulsion includes absence of consent or certain threats (humiliation/property/financial loss); consent may be expressed or implied.
