Case Summary 
Procedural Posture 
The United States sought certiorari review of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the  First Circuit, which affirmed the suppression of mail seized pursuant to a search warrant that formed the  basis of defendants' indictments for unlawful possession of stolen mail. The court of appeals held  defendants had "automatic standing" to challenge the search warrant and that the warrant was  constitutionally inadequate. 
Overview 
Defendants were charged with unlawful possession of stolen mail after police discovered stolen checks  during a search of the apartment of one of the defendant's mother, pursuant to a search warrant. The  granting of a motion to suppress the checks was affirmed by the court of appeals, which found the  warrant constitutionally inadequate and held that defendants were not required to establish a legitimate  expectation of privacy in the premises searched or property seized since possession of the seized  evidence was an essential element of the offenses charged pursuant to Jones v. United States, 362 U.S.  257 (1960). The United States Supreme Court reversed, overruling the "automatic standing" rule of  Jones. It first noted that only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated could benefit  from the exclusionary rule. The Court then held that a prosecutor could, with legal consistency and  legitimacy, assert that a defendant charged with possession of a seized item did not have a privacy  interest violated in the course of the search and seizure, and that an illegal search only violated the rights  of those with a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place. 
Outcome
448 U.S. 83, *83; 100 S. Ct. 2547, **2547; 65 L. Ed. 2d 619, ***619; 1980 U.S. LEXIS 141, ****1
The Court reversed the decision affirming the trial court's order suppressing the evidence and remanded  the matter to allow defendants the opportunity to demonstrate, if they can, that their own Fourth  Amendment rights were violated. 
Syllabus 
 Respondents were charged with unlawful possession of stolen mail. The checks that formed the basis  of the indictment had been seized by police during a search, conducted pursuant to a warrant, of an  apartment rented by one respondent's mother. Respondents moved to suppress the checks on the  ground that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant was inadequate to show  probable cause. The District Court granted the motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, in  reliance on Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, that since respondents were charged with crimes of  possession, they were entitled to claim "automatic standing" to challenge the legality of the search  without regard to whether they had an expectation of privacy in the premises [****2] searched. 
Held: Defendants charged with crimes of possession may only claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule  if their own Fourth Amendment rights have in fact been violated. Jones v. United States, supra,  overruled. Pp. 86-95. 
(a) The "dilemma" identified in Jones (and given as one of the two reasons for establishing the  "automatic standing" rule as an exception to the exclusionary rule) that a defendant charged with a  possessory offense might only be able to establish his standing to challenge a search and seizure by  giving self-incriminating testimony admissible as evidence of his guilt, was eliminated by Simmons v.  United States, 390 U.S. 377, wherein it was held that testimony given by a defendant in support of a  motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evidence of his guilt at trial. Pp. 89-90. 
(b) The second reason given in Jones for the "automatic standing" rule that such rule would prevent the  "vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction" whereby the Government would assert that the defendant  possessed the goods in question for purposes of criminal liability while simultaneously asserting that he  did not possess [****3] them for the purposes of claiming the protections of the Fourth Amendment, has  likewise been eroded. It is now the rule that a prosecutor, without legal contradiction, may  simultaneously maintain that a defendant criminally possessed the seized goods but was not subject to a  Fourth Amendment deprivation. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128. The underlying assumption for such  "vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction" that possession of seized goods is the equivalent of Fourth  Amendment "standing" to challenge the search creates too broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth  Amendment rights. Rather, it must be asked not merely whether the defendant has a possessory  interest in the items seized but also whether he had an expectation of privacy in the area searched. Pp.  90-93. 
(c) The issue whether the prosecutor, although not permitted under Simmons v. United States, supra, to  use a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing as substantive evidence of guilt at trial, may still be  permitted to use such testimony to impeach the defendant at trial, need not be resolved here, since it is  an issue that more aptly relates to the proper breadth [****4] of the Simmons privilege and not to the  need for retaining automatic standing. Pp. 93-94. 
(d) Respondents' argument that the "automatic standing" rule should be retained since it maximizes the  deterrence of illegal police conduct by permitting an expanded class of potential challengers, is without  merit. Pp. 94-95.

Opinion 
 [*84] [***623] [**2549] MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.  
 [1A] [****5] Relying on Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960), the Court of Appeals for the First  Circuit held that since respondents were charged with crimes of possession, they were [*85] entitled to  claim "automatic standing" to challenge the legality of the search which produced the evidence against  them, without regard to whether they had an expectation of privacy in the premises searched. 599 F.2d  1094 (1979). Today we hold that defendants charged with crimes of possession may only claim the  benefits of the exclusionary rule if their own Fourth Amendment rights have in fact been violated. The  automatic standing rule [***624] of Jones v. United States, supra, is therefore overruled. 
I 
Respondents, John Salvucci and Joseph Zackular, were charged in a federal indictment with 12 counts  of unlawful possession of stolen mail, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1708. The 12 checks which formed the  basis of the indictment had been seized by the Massachusetts [****6] police during the search of an  apartment rented by respondent Zackular's mother. The search was conducted pursuant to a warrant. 
Respondents filed a motion to suppress the checks on the ground that the affidavit supporting the  application for the search warrant was inadequate to demonstrate probable cause. The District Court  granted respondents' motions and ordered that the checks be suppressed. 1 The Government sought  reconsideration of the District Court's ruling, contending that respondents [**2550] lacked "standing" to  challenge the constitutionality of the search. The District Court reaffirmed its suppression order and the  Government appealed. 
The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that respondents had "standing" and the search warrant was  constitutionally inadequate. The court found that the respondents [****7] were not required to establish a  legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises searched or the property seized because they were  entitled to assert "automatic standing" to object to the search [*86] and seizure under Jones v. United  States, supra. The court observed that the vitality of the Jones doctrine had been challenged in recent  years, but that "[until] the Supreme Court rules on this question, we are not prepared to hold that the  automatic standing rule of Jones has been . . . overruled. . . . That is an issue which the Supreme Court  
1 The District Court held that the affidavit was deficient because the affiant relied on double hearsay, and failed to specify the  dates on which information included in the affidavit had been obtained.

must resolve." 599 F.2d, at 1098. The Court of Appeals was obviously correct in its characterization of  the status of Jones, and we granted certiorari in order to resolve the controversy. 2 444 U.S. 989 (1979). 
 [****8] II 
As early as 1907, this Court took the position that remedies for violations of constitutional rights would  only be afforded to a person who "belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is  given." Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U.S. 152, 160. The exclusionary rule is one form of remedy afforded for  Fourth Amendment violations, and the Court in Jones v. United States held that the Hatch v. Reardon 
principle properly limited its availability. The Court reasoned that ordinarily "it is entirely proper to require  of one who [***625] seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant  evidence that he . . . establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy." 362 U.S., at 261.  Subsequent attempts to vicariously assert violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of others have been  repeatedly rejected by this Court. Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 174 (1969); Brown v. United  States, 411 U.S. 223, 230 [*87] (1973). Most recently, in Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978), we held  that " [****9] it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to  benefit from the [exclusionary] rule's protections." Id., at 134. 
Even though the Court in Jones recognized that the exclusionary rule should only be available to protect  defendants who have been the victims of an illegal search or seizure, the Court thought it necessary to  establish an exception. In cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of  the offense charged, the Court held that the defendant was not obligated to establish that his own Fourth  Amendment rights had been violated, but only that the search and seizure of the evidence was  unconstitutional. 3 Upon such a showing, the exclusionary rule would be available to prevent the  admission of the evidence against the defendant. 
 [****10] [2A]The Court found that the prosecution of such possessory offenses presented a "special  problem" which necessitated the departure from the then settled principles of [**2551] Fourth  Amendment "standing." 4 Two circumstances were found to require this exception. First, the Court found  that in order to establish standing at a hearing on a motion to suppress, the defendant would often be  "forced to allege facts the proof of which would tend, if indeed not be sufficient, to convict him," since  several Courts of Appeals had "pinioned a defendant within this dilemma" by holding that evidence  adduced at the motion [*88] to suppress could be used against the defendant at trial. 362 U.S., at 262.  The Court declined to embrace any rule which would require a defendant to assert his Fourth  Amendment claims only at the risk of providing the prosecution with self-incriminating statements  admissible at trial. The Court sought resolution of this dilemma by relieving the defendant of the  
2 The Courts of Appeals have divided on the continued applicability of the automatic standing rule. The Sixth Circuit abandoned  the rule after our decision in Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968). See, e. g., United States v. Hunter, 550 F.2d 1066  (1977). Most of the remaining Circuits appear to have retained the rule, but many with "misgivings." See, e. g., United States v.  Oates, 560 F.2d 45, 52 (CA2 1977); United States v. Edwards, 577 F.2d 883, 892 (CA5), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 968 (1978). 
3 In Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 229 (1973), this Court clarified that the automatic standing rule of Jones was  applicable only where the offense charged "possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search and seizure." 
4 [2B] 
In Rakas, this Court discarded reliance on concepts of "standing" in determining whether a defendant is entitled to claim the  protections of the exclusionary rule. The inquiry, after Rakas, is simply whether the defendant's rights were violated by the  allegedly illegal search or seizure. Because Jones was decided at a time when "standing" was designated as a separate inquiry,  we use that term for the purposes of re-examining that opinion.

448 U.S. 83, *88; 100 S. Ct. 2547, **2551; 65 L. Ed. 2d 619, ***625; 1980 U.S. LEXIS 141, ****10
obligation of establishing that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an illegal search or  seizure. [****11]  
The Court also commented that this rule would be beneficial for a second reason. Without a rule  prohibiting [***626] a Government challenge to a defendant's "standing" to invoke the exclusionary rule  in a possessory offense prosecution, the Government would be allowed the "advantage of contradictory  positions." Id., at 263. The Court reasoned that the Government ought not to be allowed to assert that the  defendant possessed the goods for purposes of criminal [****12] liability, while simultaneously asserting  that he did not possess them for the purposes of claiming the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The  Court found that "[it] is not consonant with the amenities, to put it mildly, of the administration of criminal  justice to sanction such squarely contradictory assertions of power by the Government." Id., at 263-264.  Thus in order to prevent both the risk that self-incrimination would attach to the assertion of Fourth  Amendment rights, as well as to prevent the "vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction," see Brown v.  United States, supra, at 229, the Court adopted the rule of "automatic standing."  
 [1B]In the 20 years which have lapsed since the Court's decision in Jones, the two reasons which led  the Court to the rule of automatic standing have likewise been affected by time. This Court has held that  testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evidence of his  guilt at trial. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968). Developments in the principles [****13] of  Fourth Amendment standing, as well, clarify that a prosecutor may, with legal consistency and legitimacy,  assert that a defendant [*89] charged with possession of a seized item did not have a privacy interest  violated in the course of the search and seizure. We are convinced not only that the original tenets of the  Jones decision have eroded, but also that no alternative principles exist to support retention of the rule. 
A 
The "dilemma" identified in Jones, that a defendant charged with a possessory offense might only be  able to establish his standing to challenge a search and seizure by giving self-incriminating testimony  admissible as evidence of his guilt, was eliminated by our decision in Simmons v. United States, supra. In Simmons , the defendant Garrett was charged with bank robbery. During the search of a  codefendant's mother's house, physical evidence used in the bank robbery, including a suitcase, was  found in the basement and seized. In an effort to establish his standing to assert the illegality of the  search, Garrett testified at the [****14] suppression hearing that the suitcase was similar to one he  owned and that he [**2552] was the owner of the clothing discovered inside the suitcase. Garrett's  motion to suppress was denied, but his testimony was admitted into evidence against him as part of the  Government's case-in-chief at trial. This Court reversed, finding that "a defendant who knows that his  testimony may be admissible against him at trial will sometimes be deterred from presenting the  testimonial proof of standing [***627] necessary to assert a Fourth Amendment claim." 390 U.S., at 392- 393. The Court found that, in effect, the defendant was 
"obliged either to give up what he believed, with advice of counsel, to be a valid Fourth Amendment claim  or, in legal effect, to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In these  circumstances, we find it intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order  to assert another. We therefore hold that when a defendant testifies in support of a motion to suppress  evidence on Fourth Amendment [*90] grounds, [****15] his testimony may not thereafter be admitted  against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection." Id., at 394.

This Court's ruling in Simmons thus not only extends protection against this risk of self-incrimination in all  of the cases covered by Jones, but also grants a form of "use immunity" to those defendants charged  with nonpossessory crimes. In this respect, the protection of Simmons is therefore broader than that of  Jones. Thus, as we stated in Brown v. United States, 411 U.S., at 228, "[the] self-incrimination dilemma,  so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the  Constitution [in Simmons]." 
B 
This Court has identified the self-incrimination rationale as the cornerstone of the Jones opinion. See  Brown v. United States, supra, at 228. We need not belabor the question of whether the "vice" of  prosecutorial contradiction could alone support a rule countenancing the exclusion of probative evidence  on the grounds that someone other than the defendant was denied a Fourth Amendment right. The  simple answer [****16] is that the decisions of this Court, especially our most recent decision in Rakas v.  Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978), clearly establish that a prosecutor may simultaneously maintain that a  defendant criminally possessed the seized good, but was not subject to a Fourth Amendment deprivation, without legal contradiction. To conclude that a prosecutor engaged in self-contradiction in  Jones, the Court necessarily relied on the unexamined assumption that a defendant's possession of a  seized good sufficient to establish criminal culpability was also sufficient to establish Fourth Amendment "standing." This assumption, however, even if correct at the time, is no longer so. 5 
 [****17] [*91] [3]The person in legal possession of a good seized during an illegal search has not  necessarily been subject to a Fourth Amendment deprivation. 6 [***628] As we hold today in Rawlings v.  Kentucky, post, p. 98, legal possession of a seized good is not a proxy for determining whether the  owner had a Fourth Amendment interest, for it does not [**2553] invariably represent the protected  Fourth Amendment interest. This Court has repeatedly repudiated the notion that "arcane distinctions  developed in property and tort law" ought to control our Fourth Amendment inquiry. Rakas v. Illinois,  supra, at 143. In another section of the opinion in Jones itself, the Court concluded that, "it is  unnecessary and ill-advised to import into the law surrounding the constitutional right to be free from  unreasonable searches and seizures subtle distinctions, developed and refined by the common law in  evolving the body of private property law. . . ." 362 U.S., at 266. [****18] See also Mancusi v. DeForte,  392 U.S. 364 (1968); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967). 
 [4]While property ownership is clearly a factor to be considered in determining whether an individual's  Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, see Rakas, supra, at 144, n. 12, [****19] property rights  are neither the beginning nor the end of this Court's inquiry. In Rakas, this Court held that an illegal  search only violates the rights of those who have "a legitimate [*92] expectation of privacy in the  invaded place." 439 U.S., at 140. See also Mancusi v. DeForte, supra. 
5 Respondent Salvucci cites this Court's decision in United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48 (1951), as support for the view that  legal ownership of the seized good was sufficient to confer Fourth Amendment "standing." In Rakas, however, we stated that  "[standing] in Jeffers was based on Jeffers' possessory interest in both the premises searched and the property seized." 439  U.S., at 136. (Emphasis added.) 
6 Legal possession of the seized good may be sufficient in some circumstances to entitle a defendant to seek the return of the  seized property if the seizure, as opposed to the search, was illegal. See, e. g., United States v. Lisk, 522 F.2d 228 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1078 (1976), although in that case the property was ultimately found not to have been  illegally seized. We need not explore this issue since respondents did not challenge the constitutionality of the seizure of the  evidence.

 [5]We simply decline to use possession of a seized good as a substitute for a factual finding that the  owner of the good had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched. In Jones, the Court held  not only that automatic standing should be conferred on defendants charged with crimes of possession,  but, alternatively, that Jones had actual standing because he was "legitimately on the premises" at the  time of the search. In Rakas, this Court rejected the adequacy of this second Jones standard, finding  that it was "too broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth Amendment rights." 439 U.S., at 142. In  language appropriate to our consideration of the automatic standing rule as well, we reasoned: 
"In abandoning 'legitimately on premises' for [****20] the doctrine that we announce today, we are not  forsaking a time-tested and workable rule, which has produced consistent results when applied, solely for  the sake of fidelity to the values underlying the Fourth Amendment. Rather, we are rejecting blind  adherence to a phrase which at most has superficial clarity and which conceals underneath that thin  veneer all of the problems of line drawing which must be faced [***629] in any conscientious effort to  apply the Fourth Amendment. Where the factual premises for a rule are so generally prevalent that little  would be lost and much would be gained by abandoning case-by-case analysis, we have not hesitated to  do so. . . . We would not wish to be understood as saying that legitimate presence on the premises is  irrelevant to one's expectation of privacy, but it cannot be deemed controlling." Id., at 147-148. 
As in Rakas, we again reject "blind adherence" to the other underlying assumption in Jones that  possession of the seized good is an acceptable measure of Fourth Amendment interests. As in Rakas,  we find that the Jones standard "creates too [*93] broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth  Amendment [****21] rights" and that we must instead engage in a "conscientious effort to apply the  Fourth Amendment" by asking not merely whether the defendant had a possessory interest in the items  seized, but whether he had an expectation of privacy in the area searched. Thus neither prosecutorial  "vice," nor the underlying assumption of Jones that possession of a seized good is the equivalent of  Fourth Amendment "standing" to challenge the search, can save the automatic standing rule. 
C 
Even though the original foundations of Jones are no longer relevant, respondents assert that principles  not articulated by the Court in Jones support retention of the rule. First, respondents maintain that while  Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 [**2554] (1968), eliminated the possibility that the prosecutor  could use a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing as substantive evidence of guilt at trial,  Simmons did not eliminate other risks to the defendant which attach to giving testimony on a motion to  suppress. 7 [****23] Principally, respondents assert that the prosecutor may still be permitted to use the  defendant's testimony to impeach him at trial. 8 This Court [****22] [*94] has not decided whether  Simmons precludes the use of a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing to impeach his  testimony at trial. 9 But the issue presented here is quite different from the one of whether "use immunity"  
7 The respondents argue that the prosecutor's access to the suppression testimony will unfairly provide the prosecutor with  information advantageous to the preparation of his case and trial strategy. This argument, however, is surely applicable equally  to possessory and nonpossessory offenses. This Court has clearly declined to expand the Jones rule to other classes of  offenses, Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223 (1973), and thus respondents'  rationale cannot support the retention of a special rule of automatic standing here. 
8 A number of courts considering the question have held that such testimony is admissible as evidence of impeachment. Gray v.  State, 43 Md. App. 238, 403 A. 2d 853 (1979); People v. Douglas, 66 Cal. App. 3d 998, 136 Cal. Rptr. 358 (1977); People v.  Sturgis, 58 Ill. 2d 211, 317 N. E. 2d 545 (1974). See also Woody v. United States, 126 U. S. App. D. C. 353, 354-355, 379 F.2d  130, 131-132 (Burger, J.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 961 (1967).

extends only through the Government's case-in-chief, or beyond that to the direct and cross-examination  of a defendant in the event he chooses to take the stand. That issue [***630] need not be and is not  resolved here, for it is an issue which more aptly relates to the proper breadth of the Simmons privilege,  and not to the need for retaining automatic standing. 
Respondents also seek to retain the Jones rule on the grounds that it is said to maximize the deterrence  of illegal police conduct by permitting an expanded class of potential challengers. The same argument  has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless [****24] claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule. In Alderman  v. United States, 394 U.S., at 174-175, we explicitly stated: 
"The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have  been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evidence even though the case against  the defendant is weakened or destroyed. We adhere to that judgment. But we are not convinced that  the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further  encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted  or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth." 
See also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S., at 137; United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U.S. 268, 275-276 (1978);  United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 350-351 (1974). Respondents' deterrence [*95] argument  carries no special force in the context of possessory offenses and we therefore again reject it.  
 [****25] [1C]We are convinced that the automatic standing rule of Jones has outlived its usefulness in  this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. The doctrine now serves only to afford a windfall to  defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have not been violated. We are unwilling to tolerate the  exclusion of probative evidence under such circumstances since we adhere to the view of Alderman that  the values of the Fourth Amendment are preserved by a rule which limits the availability of the  exclusionary rule to defendants who have been [**2555] subjected to a violation of their Fourth  Amendment rights.  
 [6]This action comes to us as a challenge to a pretrial decision suppressing evidence. The respondents  relied on automatic standing and did not attempt to establish that they had a legitimate expectation of  privacy in the areas of Zackular's mother's home where the goods were seized. We therefore think it  appropriate to remand so that respondents will have an opportunity to demonstrate, if they can, that their  own Fourth [****26] Amendment rights were violated. See Combs v. United States, 408 U.S. 224  (1972).

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.  
Today the Court overrules the "automatic standing" rule of Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960),  because it concludes that the rationale underpinning the rule has been "eroded," ante, at 89. [***631] I  do not share that view. 
A defendant charged with a possessory offense who moves to suppress the items he is charged with  possessing must now establish at the suppression hearing that the police conduct of which he complains  violated his personal Fourth Amendment rights. In many cases, a defendant will be able to make the  required showing only by taking the stand and testifying about his interest in the place searched and the  evidence [*96] seized; the need for the defendant's own testimony may, in fact, be more likely to arise in  possession cases than in cases involving other types of offenses. The holding in Jones was premised, in  part, on the unfairness of "[pinioning] a defendant within [the] dilemma," [****27] 362 U.S., at 262, of  being able to assert his Fourth Amendment claim only by relinquishing his Fifth Amendment privilege  against self-incrimination. The Court finds that this dilemma no longer exists because Simmons v. United  States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968), held that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress  "may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection."  Id., at 394. 
I cannot agree that Simmons provides complete protection against the "self-incrimination dilemma,"  Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 228 (1973). Respondents contend that the testimony given at the  suppression hearing might be held admissible for impeachment purposes and, while acknowledging that  that question is not before us in this case, the majority broadly hints that this is so. Ante, at 94, n. 9; see  Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971); United States v. Kahan, 415 U.S. 239 (1974); United States v.  Havens, 446 U.S. 620 (1980); Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231 (1980); [****28] but see New Jersey v.  Portash, 440 U.S. 450 (1979). The use of the testimony for impeachment purposes would subject a  defendant to precisely the same dilemma, unless he was prepared to relinquish his constitutional right to  testify in his own defense, and would thereby create a strong deterrent to asserting Fourth Amendment claims. One of the purposes of Jones and Simmons was to remove such obstacles. See Simmons,  supra, at 392-394. Moreover, the opportunity for cross-examination at the suppression hearing may  enable the prosecutor to elicit incriminating information beyond that offered on direct examination to  establish the requisite Fourth Amendment interest. Even if such information could not be introduced at  the subsequent trial, it might be helpful to the prosecution in developing its case or deciding its trial  strategy. The furnishing [*97] of such a tactical advantage to the prosecution should not be the price of  asserting a Fourth Amendment claim. Simmons, therefore, does not eliminate the possibility that a  defendant will be deterred from presenting a Fourth Amendment claim because of "the risk that the  words [**2556] [****29] which he utters may later be used to incriminate him." [***632] Simmons,  supra, at 393. Accordingly, I conclude that this part of the reasoning in Jones remains viable. 
A second ground for relieving the defendant charged with possession from the necessity of showing "an  interest in the premises searched or the property seized" was that "to hold to the contrary . . . would be to  permit the Government to have the advantage of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction,"  Jones, 362 U.S., at 263. That is, since "possession both convicts and confers standing," ibid., the  Government, which had charged the defendant with possession, would not be permitted to deny that he  had standing. By holding today in Rawlings v. Kentucky, post, p. 98, that a person may assert a Fourth  Amendment claim only if he has a privacy interest in the area that was searched, the Court has, to be  sure, done away with that logical inconsistency. For reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in that case,  I believe that holding is diametrically opposed to the meaning of the Fourth Amendment as it has always  been understood.

In sum, I find neither of the [****30] Court's grounds for abandoning Jones persuasive. The automatic  standing rule is a salutary one which protects the rights of defendants and eliminates the wasteful  requirement of making a preliminary showing of standing in pretrial proceedings involving possessory  offenses, where the charge itself alleges an interest sufficient to support a Fourth Amendment claim. I  dissent.
