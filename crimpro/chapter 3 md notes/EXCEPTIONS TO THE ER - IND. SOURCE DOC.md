*Independent Source Doctrine; Inevitable Discovery; Attenuation of the Taint; Special Applications for Statements After 4A Violations; Fruit of the Poisonous Tree;* 

*Segura → Murray → Nix trilogy.*

*Primary evidence seized directly in an illegal search/seizure is suppressed; Derivative evidence (“fruit”) is also suppressed unless an exception breaks the causal/remedial link*

Independent Source Doctrine  
***Rule***: Even if police violate 4A, evidence is admissible if it is later obtained through a source independent of the illegality, i.e., a lawful path untainted by the earlier misconduct.

Segura v. United States  
***Facts***: Agents unlawfully entered an apartment and remained until a warrant arrived. Agents arrested Segura in the building lobby and then entered the apartment without a warrant and without exigent circumstances. Evidence first found during execution of a valid, untainted warrant was admitted as coming from an independent source. If the warrant application and probable cause are wholly unconnected to the illegal entry, the suppressing later-discovered evidence does not add meaningful deterrence.   
***Procedure***: District court suppressed all evidence; second circuit suppressed only plain-view evidence from illegal entry, but admitted warrant evidence; supreme court: affirmed second circuit.  
***Issue***: Did the agents’ warrantless entry and securing of the apartment require suppression of evidence later seized under a valid search warrant? Was the evidence seized under the warrant the fruit of the poisonous tree, or did the independent source doctrine apply?  
***Rule***: Evidence discovered pursuant to a valid search warrant is admissible if: the warrant is supported by information independent of illegal conduct, and the illegal conduct did not contribute to the discovery of the evidence. The ER applies only when suppression would provide meaningful deterrence of police misconduct.

Murray v. United States  
***Facts***: Agents surveilled defendants driving vehicles into and out of a warehouse. Vehicles were later lawfully stopped and found to contain cannabis. Based on this information, agents forcibly entered their warehouse establishment without a warrant. Inside they saw bales of maijuana in plain view. Agents immediately exited, did not disturb evidence, and kept the warehouse under surveillance.   
***Procedure***: Petitioners were convicted in federal district court of conspiracy to possess and distribute illegal drugs. They moved pretrial to suppress evidence seized from a warehouse, arguing it was tainted by an earlier illegal entry and by omissions in the warrant application. The district court denied suppression. The First Circuit affirmed, assuming (for suppression analysis) the first entry was unlawful. The SC granted certiorari (limited to the 4A issue) and vacated and remanded for additional fact-finding on whether the warrant search was genuinely independent.   
***Issue***: Does the Fourth Amendment require suppression of evidence that officers first observed during an illegal warrantless entry, if they later seize that same evidence during a search conducted under a valid warrant that is wholly independent of the illegal entry?  
***Rule***: Evidence initially discovered during (or as a consequence of) unlawful police conduct may still be admissible if it is later obtained independently through lawful activities untainted by the initial illegality. The exclusionary rule’s goal is to put police in the same, not a worse, position than they would have been in absent the violation. 

* *The later warrant search is not an independent source if: the officer’s decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they saw during the illegal entry; or information from the illegal entry was presented to the magistrate and affected the decision to issue the warrant.*

**Independent Source Doctrine** trigger checklist:   
(1) Was the warrant affidavit based on info independent of the illegality?   
(2) Did the illegal entry influence the decision to seek the warrant?  
(3) Did the illegal entry influence the magistrate’s issuance decision?  
(4) If yes to (2) or (3), then no independent source, and suppression is thus justified.

Inevitable Discovery Doctrine  
Even if police misconduct helped uncover evidence, the evidence is admissible if the prosecution proves the evidence would inevitably have been discovered by lawful means anyway.

Nix v. Williams (The Search Already Underway)  
***Procedure***: Respondent was convicted of FDM in Iowa state court. After the conviction was reversed due to a 6A violation, he was retried. At the second trial, incriminating statements were excluded, but physical evidence related to the victim’s body was admitted under the inevitable discovery doctrine. Iowa SC affirmed conviction; Eighth Circuit granted habeas relief (required proof of police good faith); SCOTUS reversed.  
***Facts***: A 10 year-old girl disappeared from a YMCA in Des Moines, Iowa. Williams was seen leaving the YMCA carrying a blanket-wrapped bundle. Police found Williams’ abandoned car and items of the child’s clothing along I-80. Police inferred the body was located somewhere between Des Moines and a rest stop near Grinnell. A large-scale search was initiated: 200 volunteers, organized a grid pattern, combed westward toward the likely location of the body. Williams surrendered to police and was arraigned. Police agreed with counsel not to question Williams during transport.   
***Issue***: Whether body-related evidence is admissible on the theory it would inevitably have been discovered, even though police learned the location through unconstitutional interrogation.  
***Rule***: Body-related evidence learned through unconstitutional interrogation is admissible if the prosecution proves by preponderance that lawful means would inevitably have discovered it.  
***Rationale***: Exclusion should not put the government in a worse position than if no illegality had occurred. If discovery was truly inevitable, suppression would impose a truth-cost with little deterrence gain.

Inevitable Discovery Exam Trigger  
(1) What lawful process was already in motion (or would certainly have been used)?  
(2) How close was it to finding the evidence?  
(3) Is the inevitability based on verifiable historical facts (organized search patterns, routine inventory, scheduled warrant execution), or just speculation?  
(4) Government burden (federal): preponderance.

Attenuation of the Taint  
Even when evidence would not have been obtained “but for” the illegality, suppression is not required if the connection between the illegality and the evidence becomes so attenuated that the taint is dissipated.

This is the fruit doctrine’s limiting principle. 

Start with Wong Sun: suppress fruit unless purged by attenuation.   
For confessions/statements: Miranda warnings alone are not automatically enough under Brown.  
Use Brown factors to analyze attenuation.

Wong Sun v. United States (Dissipate the Taint)  
***Procedure***: U.S. District Court (N.D. Cal.): Bench trial. Petitioners acquittal on Count 1 (conspiracy) but convicted on Count 2: fraudulent and knowing transportation and concealment of illegally imported heroin under 21 U.S.C. 174\. Ninth Circuit held both warrantless arrests were illegal (no probable cause / reasonable grounds) but affirmed convictions, concluding the key evidence was not fruit of the illegal arrests. SCOTUS reversed and remanded.  
***Facts***: Federal narcotic agents arrest HW after weeks of surveillance. They find heroin. HW says he got it from BT. Agent undercover goes to BT, but gets rejected. Agent reveals identity, breaks into BT’s biz/home, cuffs and arrests him. No narcotics found. BT denies selling but says JY has heroin and keeps it in JY’s bedroom. Agents then go to JY’s who surrenders an oz. of heroin. JY says that the heroin came from BT and Wong Sun (WS). Agents go to WS and arrest him, but find no narcotics. BT and JY are arraigned and released on recognizance; WS arraigned next day and released. Days later, an agent takes unsigned written statements from BT and WS but both refuse to sign. Key trial evidence: BT’s bedroom oral statements at arrest; JY’s surrendered-heroin; BT’s unsigned statement; and WS’s unsigned statement.  
***Issue***: Whether Toy’s (BT’s) bedroom statements are suppressible as fruits of an unlawful entry/arrest, and if so, whether BT’s conviction stands on unsigned statements—especially using WS’s statement as corroboration. Whether Wong Sun’s (WS’s) later unsigned statement is suppressible as fruit of his unlawful arrest or is sufficiently attenuated.   
***Rule***: Evidence obtained by exploitation of illegality is suppressible. Federal law requires corroboration of admissions, and statements from unreliable and unsubstantiated sources not made in furtherance of any crime cannot be used as admissible corroborative evidence. Evidence is admissible when the connection between illegal police conduct and the evidence has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.

Attenuating the Taint  
Turns on time \+ intervening events \+ free will.

Brown v. Illinois (Miranda Warnings Not Automatic Purge)  
***Issue***: Whether Miranda warnings by themselves are enough to attenuate the 4A taint so the statements come in.  
***Rule***: Miranda warnings are relevant but not sufficient by themselves to purge the taint of an illegal arrest.

Brown Framework  
To decide whether the confession is sufficiently an act of free will to purge the taint, consider: (1) temporal proximity between illegal arrest and confession; (2) intervening circumstances; (3) purpose and flagrancy of official misconduct. Voluntariness is a threshold requirement (5A baseline). Prosecution bears the burden of showing admissibility. 

Application in Brown  
First Statement: within 2 hours, no significant intervening circumstances, thus suppressible.  
Second Statement: fruit of the first, thus suppressible.  
Police misconduct was purposeful/investigatory (for questioning) and involved surprise/fright tactics, thus suppressible. 

Utah v. Strieff (Attenuation Via Discovery Valid But For Illegality)  
***Issue***: Whether discovery of a valid pre-existing warrant attenuates the connection between the illegal stop and the evidence found in a search incident to arrest.  
***Rule***: An intervening circumstance can attenuate the connection between the illegality (e.g., an illegal stop) and the evidence found in a search incident to arrest.

Applying Brown Factors  
Temporal proximity: minutes, thus favoring suppression.  
Intervening circumstances: valid, pre-existing warrant, thus strongly favors attenuation/admission.  
Purpose/flagrancy: an officer at most was negligent; no systemic misconduct was shown; thus favoring admission.

Attenuation Exam Tiggers  
(1) How soon after the illegality did the evidence appear?  
(2) What intervened? (release, magistrate, counsel, outstanding warrant, independent act by defendant, etc.)  
(3) How bad was the police conduct? (purposeful, flagrant, systemic or negligent/isolated)  
(4) For statements: Miranda is a factor, but not dispositive.

Rawlings v. Kentucky (Attenuation Permitted Despite Illegal Detention)  
***Rule***: Incriminating statements made during an illegal detention may still be admissible due to attenuation factors: lack of flagrant misconduct, non-coercive atmosphere, statements spontaneous after discovery of evidence.

New York v. Harris  
***Issue***: When police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, does the 4A’s ER require suppression of a station-house statement made after Miranda warnings if the suspect was arrested inside their home following a warrantless nonconsensual entry in violation of Payton?  
***Rule***: Where police have probable cause to arrest, the exclusionary rule does not bar the State from using a statement made outside the home, even if it was taken after an in-home arrest that violated Payton.  
***Rationale***: ER limits must relate to the purpose of the violated rule; they must bear some relation to the purpose the violated rule serves. The purpose of Payton is to protect the home’s physical integrity; the chief-evil targeted is entry into the home without judicial authorization and not to give suspects a broader protection from being questioned outside the home when police already have probable cause.

Recap Overall Federal Takeaway  
***Independent source test*** (decision to seek warrant plus magistrate not influenced)...Murray  
***Inevitable discovery*** (preponderance; no good-faith requirement)...Nix  
***Attenuation factors***…Brown  
***Warrant as intervening circumstance***…Strieff  
***Stationhouse statement admissible despite Payton-type home entry violation*** (under the typical probable-cause framing)...Harris
