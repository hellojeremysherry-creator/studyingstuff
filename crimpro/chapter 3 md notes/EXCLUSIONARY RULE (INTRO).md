*Fourth Amendment; search and seizure violations. Fifth Amendment; privilege against self-incrimination / interrogation issues. Due Process identification issues.*

**Constitutional criminal procedure; evidence (“material”) obtained** in violation of the USC may not be introduced at trial against a criminal defendant.

**The exclusionary rule (ER) is designed to discourage police** from violating constitutional rights because illegally obtained evidence will not help secure convictions. The rule is a judicially created remedy aimed at safeguarding Fourth Amendment rights through deterrence.

**For ER**: *deterrence of police misconduct; judicial integrity; legitimacy / anti-profiting-from-wrongdoing.* 

**Against ER**: *substantial social costs; perverse incentives for judges; the remedy is unnecessary if alternative deterrents exist.*

Hudson v. Michigan  
*ISSUE*: Whether a knock-and-announce violation requires suppression of evidence found during the search.  
*RULE*: The ER does not apply to knock-and-announce violations.  
*MAJORITY*: Exclusion is a last resort, not the first impulse. Apply exclusion only when deterrence benefits outweigh substantial social costs. Suppression is a jackpot remedy; it would generate a flood of litigation. Low deterrence value for knock-and-announce: the rule protects interests different from the evidence-seizure interest; suppression is incongruent.   
*DISSENT*: Skeptical that civil remedies actually deter. Home privacy and constitutional tradition.

Weeks v. United States  
*ISSUE*: Must federal courts exclude evidence seized by federal officials in violation of the Fourth Amendment?  
*RULE*: Evidence taken by a federal officer in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment must be returned and cannot be used at trial. Federal courts exclude evidence obtained by federal agents through unconstitutional searches/seizures.   
*RATIONALE*: The Fourth Amendment must have real effect; otherwise it is of no value. Courts cannot sanction lawless evidence-gathering. Marshal could only enter with a proper warrant based on sworn information and particular description.  
*LIMITATION*: The Court treated seizures by local police differently where they did not act under federal authority (the focus at the time \- 1914 \- was the Fourth applied to federal actors).

Mapp v. Ohio.  
*ISSUE*: Does the Fourteenth Amendment require state courts to exclude evidence obtained by searches and seizures that violate the Fourth Amendment (i.e., does the federal ER apply to the states).  
*RULE*: Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process makes that Fourth Amendment protection enforceable against the States. Any evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Federal Constitution is inadmissible in a criminal trial in state court.

Herring v. United States  
*ISSUE*: When an arrest is unconstitutional due to negligent recordkeeping, must evidence found during a search incident to arrest be suppressed?  
*RULE*: No suppression for an isolated negligent error. Exclusion applies only when police conduct is deliberate, reckless, grossly negligent, or part of recurring/systemic negligence. Negligent (non-systemic) mistakes generally do not trigger exclusion.  
*MAJORITY*: Exclusion is a judicially created deterrent remedy, not an automatic right. Deterrence varies with culpability: suppression is most justified for flagrant violations. When error is attenuated from the arrest and further characterized as an isolated occurrence, suppression would not yield a sufficient remedial benefit.  
*DISSENT*: Negligence rules in tort law create incentives; suppression can incentivize better database maintenance. E-errors may threaten liberty. 

Arizona v. Gant; Davis v. United States  
*ISSUE*: If a police officer acted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent that was later overruled, does exclusion apply?  
*RULE*: Evidence obtained under objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent is not subject to the ER (good-faith/nonculpable conduct category).  
*MAJORITY*: Exclusion’s sole purpose is deterrence. When police follow then-binding law, there’s no culpable misconduct to deter. Suppression would deter only conscientious police work, while imposing major social costs.   
*DISSENT*: Retroactivity without a remedy is hollow. This good-faith exception risks swallowing the rule because many Fourth Amendment violations come from reasonable mistakes.

**Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally excluded from the prosecution’s case-in-chief.** 

**Suppression is not automatic—apply a deterrence / social cost analysis** and focus on culpability. No suppression for: knock-and-announce violations; isolated negligence; officers relying on binding precedent later changed. Exclusion is reserved for deliberate/reckless/gross negligence or systemic issues. 

1\) Was there a constitutional violation?  
2\) Does exclusion apply under deterrence/cost \+ culpability?  
3\) If not, evidence comes in, even though the police conduct was unconstitutional.

**NY rejects the federal good-faith exception** from United States v. Leon as a matter of state constitutional law.

* Even if officers acted in objective good faith under a warrant later found invalid—NY may still suppress.

**CA applies a Truth-in-Evidence provision (Proposition 8\)** — a CA constitutional rule. Relevant evidence shall not be excluded in criminal cases except as required by the U.S. Constitution (and certain statutory/limited exceptions). 

* In re Lance W., the California Supreme Court interpreted this to mean California courts generally cannot create/maintain state-law exclusionary rules that give defendants more protection than the federal Fourth Amendment requires.

**CA uses a statutory motion-to-suppress** procedure under Penal Code 1538.5*.* If a search violates federal Fourth Amendment standards, suppression remains possible (because federal law is till the floor).

* If conduct violates only CA search-and-seizure protections beyond federal, Prop 8 often blocks suppression (depending on the specific statutory/constitutional hook).
