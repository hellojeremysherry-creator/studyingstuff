  
**You can suppress evidence only if your own Fourth Amendment rights were violated**, which usually turns on whether you had a legitimate reasonable expectation of privacy in the place/thing searched. Rakas v. Illinois; Rawlings v. Kentucky; United States v. Salvucci

Did the challenged search/seizure violate this defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights?

**Two hooks**: search, and seizure. **Standing to challenge a search** (privacy-based) requires a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched (or sometimes the item/container searched). **Standing to challenge a seizure** (person-based) requires that you were seized (e.g., by a traffic stop).

A passenger often cannot challenge the search of the car’s compartments (Rakas), but can challenge the stop itself as an unlawful seizure (Brendlin v. California).

Rakas v. Illinois  
***Issue***: Can passengers suppress evidence from a car search when they do not own the car and do not claim ownership of the items seized?  
***Rule***: Passengers cannot suppress evidence from a car search when they do not own the car and do not claim ownership of the items seized because the movant bears the burden of showing that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated, and Fourth Amendment rights are personal and not vicariously asserted. Being “legitimately on the premises” is not enough by itself; the relevant question is whether the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the particular area searched.  
***Majority***: Passengers generally have no legitimate expectation of privacy in the glove compartment (especially a locked one), or the area under the seat or trunk. The ER is a tool to effectuate personal Fourth Amendment rights, and expanding ER to people whose rights were not violated would increase social costs (more ER litigation; reliable evidence excluded).  
***Dissent***: Majority effectively ties Fourth Amendment protection too closely to property/ownership concepts and invites an open season on cars with multiple occupants.

Rawlings v. Kentucky  
***Issue***: Can a defendant raise the ER for evidence found inside another person’s belongings while visiting premises being searched?  
***Rule***: A defendant can not raise the ER because they had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the other person’s belongings while visiting premises being searched. Ownership of the seized item (contraband) is not enough by itself; the controlling question remains privacy in the place/container searched.

* Rawlings is basically Rakas but applied to containers/belongings.  
* You don’t get to suppress just because it’s your stuff if it was found in a place you had no reasonable privacy interest in.

United States v. Salvucci  
***Issue***: Whether defendants charged with possession of seized evidence automatically have Fourth Amendment standing to challenge the legality of the search and seizure under the ER.  
***Rule***: Fourth Amendment rights are personal and may be asserted only by individuals whose own legitimate expectation of privacy has been violated, not merely by those harmed by the introduction of damaging evidence.   
***Rationale***: A defendant charged with a possessory offense must demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched to challenge the search under the Fourth Amendment.

Simmons v. United States  
***Issue***: Whether a defendant’s testimony at a suppression hearing may later be used against them at trial on the issue of guilt.  
***Rule***: A defendant’s testimony given solely to establish standing for a Fourth Amendment motion cannot be used against him at trial, because forcing such use would require surrender of the Fifth Amendment to assert the Fourth. 

* When a defendant testifies to establish standing for a Fourth Amendment motion, that testimony cannot be used against him at trial unless he waives the Fifth Amendment privilege.

***Rationale***: To assert a Fourth Amendment right, Garrett had to testify to ownership. That testimony directly incriminated him. Admitting the testimony forced him to choose between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments. 

Minnesota v. Olson  
***Issue***: Whether overnight guests have a legitimate / reasonable expectation of privacy.  
***Rule***: Overnight guest status is sufficient to establish an expectation of privacy in the host’s home that society recognizes as reasonable.

Minnesota v. Carter  
***Issue***: Whether short-term commercial visitors have a legitimate / reasonable expectation of privacy sufficient to complain about the officer’s observations (and suppress fruits).  
***Rule***: Short-term commercial visitors do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy.   
***Majority***: Short-term visitors are not overnight guests. Their visit was brief and purely commercial; they had no prior relationship with the lessee; the apartment was a home to the lessee but not a home to short-term commercial visitors. Privacy expectations in commercial settings are generally less than in the home.   
***Concurrence***: A home’s special status suggests almost all social guests should have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their host’s home . Since short term commercial visitors are otherwise fleeting and insubstantial, they should therefore not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the same way as nearly all social guests.  
***Dissent***: Excluding short-term commercial visitors from having a legitimate expectation of privacy undermines home security: if a homeowner invites a guest to share space and activity (licit or illicit), the guest should share the host’s Fourth Amendment shelter.  

Brendlin v. California  
***Issue***: Whether a passenger is seized by a traffic stop (or only the driver) for Fourth Amendment purposes, even if the passenger is not the officer’s investigative target, and if so, whether the passenger may challenge the constitutionality of the stop and seek suppression of evidence as fruit of that stop.  
***Rule***: Fourth Amendment Seizure (Show of Authority / Physical Force): A person is seized when an officer, by physical force or show of authority, restrains freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. A show-of-authority seizure requires actual submission.  

* Objective Reasonable Person Test: Would a reasonable person not feel free to leave?  
* Traffic Stop Seizure Rule: A passenger is seized during a traffic stop the moment the car is due to respond to police authority, so the passenger may challenge the stop’s constitutionality. 

***Rationale***: Uses an objective test (reasonable person) rather than an officer's subjective intent. A traffic stop curtails the passenger’s travel just as much as the driver’s, and a reasonable passenger would not feel free to leave.

* Brendlin does not mean passengers can challenge every search of the car.  
* It means passengers can challenge the seizure (the stop) even if they lack a privacy interest in the car’s compartments.
